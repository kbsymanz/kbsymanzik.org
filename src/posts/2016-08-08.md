Kirsten and her friend, Joy, wanted to try eating balut before they both leave the Philippines. Balut is a Philippine street vendor food.

> A balut (spelled standardized as balot) is a developing bird embryo (usually a duck or chicken) that is boiled and eaten from the shell. It originates and is commonly sold as street-food in the Philippines. They are common food in countries in Southeast Asia. The Tagalog and Malay word balut means "wrapped".

The length of incubation before the egg is cooked is a matter of local preference, but generally ranges between 14 and 21 days.

Our friend, Jeff, loves balut.  He took the girls to get some and then brought them back to our house to explain about and eat the balut!

The verdict was it tastes like a hard-boiled egg and chicken broth.  Just don't look to closely at the baby duck in the egg!!!
