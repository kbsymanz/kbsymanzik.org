Sometimes kids come to our gate looking to earn a bit of money. Today, two young girls came by, and in their best English while pointing to the dirt on the sidewalk outside our gate, they said,

> "We want to sweep and you want to pay us."

Of course, we let them clean, and we did pay them as well as gave them each an apple.

Another day, this group of five stopped by to clean.  My heart goes out to these kids.
