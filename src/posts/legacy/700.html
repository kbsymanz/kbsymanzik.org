<p>I have recently led a 6 week study for some of the high school girls on the book "I Kissed Dating Goodbye" by Joshua Harris.  It is an excellent study.  We had a lot of fun, meaningful talks and discussion.  We hope to study "Don't Waste Your Life" by John Piper and/or "Do Hard Things" by Alex and Brett Harris for the second semester of school.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2256.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><em>2 Timothy 2:21-22  Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from</em> <em>what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set</em> <em>apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every</em> <em>good work.</em></p> <em>So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love,</em> <em>and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure</em> <em>heart.</em>
