<p>Hi!  I recently found a great "Read Through The Bible In A Year" program that takes you through the Old Testament once and the New Testament twice in a year.  The Pastor at the church we attend has encouraged our congregation to use this reading plan.</p><p>Go to this link: http://hippocampusextensions.com/mcheyneplan.html</p><p>If you follow this plan with me then, in the words of M'Cheyne who developed this reading plan, "<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SWEET</span> <span class="caps">BOND</span> OF <span class="caps">CHRISTIAN</span> <span class="caps">LOVE</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">UNITY</span> <span class="caps">WILL</span> BE <span class="caps">STRENGTHENED</span>. - We shall often be lead to think of those dear brothers and sisters in the Lord, who agree to join with us in reading these portions. We shall oftener be led to agree on earth, touching something we shall ask of God. We shall pray over the same promises, mourn over the same confessions, praise God in the same songs, and be nourished by the same words of eternal life."</p><p>So, if you choose to follow this plan, let me know!  I'll be praying for you as you grow in His Wisdom and Grace!</p>
