<p>Ben recently had  visitor from the <span class="caps">USA</span> come see him.  His name was "flat Marcus" based on the story "Flat Stanley".</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2184.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Flat Marcus with Ben and his teacher in their 3rd grade</em> <em>classroom.</em></p><p>The synopsis of the Flat Stanley story is this: Stanley Lambchop and his younger brother Arthur are given a big bulletin board by their Dad for putting pictures and posters on. He hangs it on the wall over Stanley's bed, but during the night the board falls from the wall, flattening Stanley in his sleep. He survives and makes the best of his altered state, and soon he is entering locked rooms by sliding under the door, and playing with his younger brother by being used as a kite...But one special advantage is that Flat Stanley can now visit his friends by being mailed in an envelope. </p><p>So, Ben's friend, Marcus, in the US sent a flattened version of himself to come over here and 'visit' for a while.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Flat Marcus with some of Ben's friends at school.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2186.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Street scene - jeepneys</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Trash collector</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Paying for a jeepney ride with Ben.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2189.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Playing at the arcade - one of Ben's favourite spots.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Eating a Jollibee meal - hamburger, fries, coke.</em><br /><em>Jollibee is a popular eatery in the Philippines like McDonald's</em><br /><em>is in the US.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2117.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben's karate match</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2109.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Eden Nature Park</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2106.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/23.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The market</em></p><p>Now Flat Marcus in in route to the US with some souvineers from his visit here.
