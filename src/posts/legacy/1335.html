<p>Kirsten is in Subic, near Manila, for the annual International School Athletic Competition (<span class="caps">ISAC</span>) for soccer.  The team is in third place as of this morning, but playoffs are today, so the status may change!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4280.jpg" alt="" width="410" height="272" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4283.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p>Mikayla and Ben are climbing Mt. Apo, the tallest peak in the Philippines, with some friends.  It's a three day journey.  They'll be back this evening.  I look forward to posting photos from their hike as I sent my camera with Ben to take pictures!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4281.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p>Mt. Apo is a mountain near Davao.  We can view it quite well from various locations around town.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4282.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
