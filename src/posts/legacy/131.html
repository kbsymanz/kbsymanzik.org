<p>Kirsten and Ben have joined the after school sports being held for K-5 kids at Faith.  Currently we are doing football.  In the US this sport is called 'soccer'.  (But I really think 'football' is a better term!)</p><p>Next quarter we will play baseball, and then fourth quarter will be basketball.  (I say 'we' because I and two other Moms are heading up the After School Sports Program for the kids!!  It's fun!!)</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/409.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/410.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>The Middle School had a band concert last night.  Mikayla played a duet with one of her school friends as part of the concert.  The music director here is a blessing.  He does a great job with the kids.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/412.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
