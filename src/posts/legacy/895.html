<p>Kurt was able to share at our sending church, Tyrone Covenant Presbyterian Church in Fenton, MI, on Sunday.  He skyped with me what a huge blessing it was to him.  <br />Tyrone posted this pic at Facebook and I share it here.  It is so uplifting to see the deaconate praying for my husband and our family and ministry here.  This picture is so encouraging to me.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2906.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" /><br /><em>1 Thess 5:11Therefore encourage one another and build one</em> <em>another up, just as you are doing.</em></p>
