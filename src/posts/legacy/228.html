<p>Happy Mother's Day to every mother reading this.</p><p>I thank God for the children he has given to me.  I pray they each continue to grow in His wisdom and grace.  I pray they each always seek first His kingdom and His righteousness.  And, I thank God for granting me wisdom and grace as a mother to raise them each in His ways.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/650.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla is growing into a fine young lady.  She is very gifted in writing.  She is a good friend to others, and patient (for the most part) with her siblings.  She and I enjoy going out for coffee!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/651.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten is very artistic.  She enjoys spending time 'creating concoctions' for science experiments.  She has a good sense of humor and enjoys caring for her baby brothers.  She, also, is growing into a fine young lady.  She enjoys frequenting the one craft store we've found here in Davao!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/621.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben is 'all boy.' He loves to play sports like football, basketball, baseball.  He enjoys playing army games.  He is becoming a good reader.  He enjoys helping Kirsten with her 'concoctions.'

He has a smile that can melt your heart.  He loves to scoot around in his walker, play with toys, enjoys eating papaya, rice cereal, rice, mongo beans, squash, carrots, green beans, potatoes, etc.  He came to us sickly but is now robust and healthy.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/630.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerard is getting better.  The new shunt seems to be working well.  He is smiling, starting on rice cereal, playing with toys.  He has a very calm, peaceful spirit about him. He loves to cuddle.</em></p>
