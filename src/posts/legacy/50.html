<p>One of the nice things as an American living in the Philippines is the variety of new things to eat and drink.  Just recently I have had a few opportunities to eat squid.  Once was in a seafood salad, and the other two times were plates of sizzling squid, one spicy and the other not.  Not bad.</p><p>In addition to squid, there are quite a few other new foods that we have yet to try.  One is durian which is a fruit that smells like strong garlic, and balut which is partially formed duck egg.  Both are somewhat "acquired" tastes.  We are not rushing out to try these two just yet.</p>
