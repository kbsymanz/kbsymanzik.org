<p>Mikayla is on the girl's Middle School Basketball team.  Her uniform number is 12.<br />They played a scrimmage against the girls High School team the other night.  It was a good first game for them, even if the high schoolers won.  Many of the girls on the Middle School team have not played before.</p><p>Mikayla wasn't sure at first when she joined the team if she'd like it, but now that she is gaining more basketball skills she is enjoying playing.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/924.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Prayer time at beginning of game</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/923.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Running down the court</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/922.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Game action</em></p>
