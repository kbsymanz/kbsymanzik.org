<p>I've been doing some Filipino cooking lately and have had many requests for the recipes....so, here they are!!!!!!</p><p><strong>Pork Adobo (adobong baboy)</strong><br />2 pounds boneless pork loin cut into 1" cubes<br />1/3 c vinegar<br />1/4 - 1/2 c soy sauce (I prefer silver swan or kikomon)<br />5 garlic cloves, crushed<br />2 bay leaves<br />1/8 tsp oregano<br />1/4 t peppercorns, cracked (or 1/4 t coarse ground pepper)<br />1 T - 1/2 cup sugar (depending on your taste)<br />1 cup water<br />1 tsp salt<br />Combine all ingredients in a stainless steel pot.  Bring to a boil without stirring, lower heat and simmer covered 30 minutes or longer.  Stir, continue cooking for another 30 minutes uncovered, until sauce is slightly reduced and thickened..</p><p>I like to make the above in a crock pot.  I add all the ingredients, put the lid on the crock pot, turn it to low heat and let it simmer 6 - 8 hours.  Lamay Kaayo!  (Very Yummy!)</p><p>(I like to make my adobo with lots of sauce so I usually double the sauce recipe.  The extra sauce is really good on the rice).</p><p><em>FYI</em><br />Adobo is the spanish word for sauce.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><img src="/images/legacy/1292.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="217" /><br /><strong>Coconut Macaroons</strong></p><p>3 cups grated coconut<br />2 cups sugar<br />1 1/2 cups evaporated milk<br />2 egg yolks<br />1 tsp lemon juice or rind of one lemon<br />7 T flour<br />3 - 5 drops food colouring (optional)<br />Combine coconut, sugar and milk in heavy nonstick saucepan.  Cook over low heat stirring fairly often for about 20 minutes or until it begins to thicken.  Let cool 10 minutes.  Add egg yolks and flour.  Mix well.<br />Add lemon juice or rind and food colouring (if you want to colour the cookies) to coconut mixture.  Mix well.<br />Cook again over low-medium heat, stirring constantly for about 20 minutes or until mixture no longer sticks to finger when touched lightly.<br />Drop from a greased teaspoon onto an ungreased cookie sheet one inch apart.  Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 15 minutes or until light brown.  Do not overbake because cookies will become rock hard.  Cool on rack.  Store in layers of waxed paper in tightly covered container.  They freeze well.<br />Makes about 4 dozen.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><img src="/images/legacy/1293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="333" /><br /><strong>Biko</strong><br />(Rice Cake with Caramel topping)</p><p>2 cups malagkit (Sticky rice)<br />3 1/2 cups diluted coconut milk<br />3/4 c sugar<br />1/4 c butter<br />1 egg, beaten<br />2 T butter for greasing pan</p><p>Topping - 1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk<br />3/4 cup thick coconut milk<br />2 - 3 T flour for quick thickening<br />1 tsp vanilla  flavouring</p><p>Grate 2 coconutes, squeeze out milk, or use 1 can (14 ounce) coconut milk, save 3/4 c of the thick milk for topping, dilute rest to make 3 1/2 cups.<br />Boil rice and thin coconut milk in a heavy pot stirring to keep bottom from scorching, about 15 - 20 minutes.  When rice is almost dry, lower the heat, stir in sugar and 1/4 c butter.  Let cool.  Add egg, mix well.<br />Spread the rice mixture in a well-buttered 9&#215;13" pan, bake in a preheated 300F oven for 20 minutes while preparing topping.<br />Combine all topping ingredients in a heavy saucepan, cook over low heat stirring constantly until thick, about 15 minutes, pour over rice mixture.  Turn oven heat up to 350F, continue baking until top is brown, about 15 minutes.  Serves 12.</p><p>Recipes taken from "Filipino Cooking and Entertaining Here and Abroad" by Eleanor R. Laquian.
