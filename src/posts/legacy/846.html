<p>We enjoy making recipes from the Redwall Cookbook.<br />The other night we enjoyed "Brockhall Badger Carrot Cakes."<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2746.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>3/4 cup cooked and mashed potato<br />3 medium carrots, peeled and grated<br />1 medium onion, peeled and grated<br />1/2 cup fresh breadcrumbs<br />2 tsp. chopped fresh parsley<br />3 eggs, beaten<br />salt and pepper, to taste<br />1 T vegetable oil</p><p>Mix potato, carrots, onion, breadcrumbs, parsley, eggs, salt and pepper together well.<br />Heat oil in frying pan and drop tablespoons of the batter into the pan.  Cook until the undersides of the cakes are golden brown, turn them over and cook the other side, 3 - 4 minutes per side.<br />Transfer cooked cakes to a paper towel-lined plate and keep warm in oven.  Continue with the remaining batter, adding oil to the pan as needed.<br /><em>from "The RedWall Cookbook" page 32</em></p>
