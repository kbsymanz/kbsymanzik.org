<p>Hi,</p><p>Thanks for praying for me.<br />I am feeling better since surgery.<br />Before I went to surgery my Mom sang to me my favourite hymn, "Jesus Loves Me This I Know."  Then my Daddy went with me to the pre-op area.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1903.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p>I am smiling more and starting to chew on things.  <br />I chewed the IV tubing apart and Mom and the nurses weren't so happy about that.  They wrapped my arm in a towel so I can't get to the IV now.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1905.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Me trying to chew on my IV tubing before they wrapped it up</em><br /><em>in a towel.</em></p><p>I don't like to move my left hand.  The doctor wants me to start physical therapy again so I will on Friday.<br />The doctor said I might be able to go home tomorrow!  YEAH!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1904.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>I have asthma so here I am getting a breathing treatment.</em></p><p>Keep praying for me and my family.  The nurses all tell me I'm "lucky" to have the parents I do.  I don't know about the luck thing,  I just know that Jesus loves me and I thank God for blessing me the way He has. </p><p><em>Psalm 139:14 I praise you because I am fearfully and</em> <em>wonderfully made;</em>       <em>your works are wonderful,</em>       <em>I know that full well.</em> </p>
