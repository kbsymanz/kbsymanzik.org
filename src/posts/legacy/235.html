<p>Ants.....</p> they are just part of life here.  They are everywhere.  In homes,offices, schools, stores, etc....... usually in small numbers..... <p>but, sometimes,  a mob congregates to attack some spilled food or dead animal.....and they do that very quickly!</p><p>which is what I woke up to in our kitchen after my Sunday afternoon nap!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/673.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>A lizard had gotten caught between the closing door and the door frame.....</p><p>Ants were making it lunch!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/672.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Needless to say, I sprayed all those little critters and ruined their lunch time for them!!!!</p>
