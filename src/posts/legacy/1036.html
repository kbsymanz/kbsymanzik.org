<p>I've been reading through Zechariah and Revelations recently.</p><p>This verse in Zechariah 9:12 really jumped out at me when I dove tail it into all the verses in the new testament that admonish us to keep on pressing on, to run the race, to endure hardship....</p><p><em>Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope;</em>    <em>today I declare that I will restore to you double.</em></p><p>Each of us are prisoners of hope.  As I trust my Heavenly Dad, resting in His leading and watchcare, even when the path makes no sense;  I know I am His;  He holds me.  He never leaves me, and He knows my name.</p><p>I love reading about other women who've suffered so much; Corrie Ten Boom, Gracia Burnham, Lilias Trotter.....<br />truly, our trials here on earth really are just "light and momentary" compared to the joy of seeing my Saviour face to face!<br />And as Corrie says, <strong>"no pit is so deep that God is not deeper</strong> <strong>still"</strong></p><p>2 Corinthians 4:16-18<br /><em>So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting</em> <em>away,</em> <em>our inner self is being renewed day by day. 17 For this light</em> <em>momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight</em><br /><em>of glory beyond all comparison, 18 as we look not to the</em><br /><em>things that are seen but to the things that are unseen.</em><br /><em>For the things that are seen are transient, but the things</em><br /><em>that are unseen are eternal.</em></p>
