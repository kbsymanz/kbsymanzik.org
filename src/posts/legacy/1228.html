<p>Hi!  It's been a while since I blogged.  We haven't dropped off the face of the earth.  !!!!</p><p>With school starting my days have been fuller with activity.</p><p>I homeschool James in the morning for his 1st grade work.  We are using <span class="caps">MCP</span> Mathematics, <span class="caps">MCP</span> Phonics, Wordly Wise 3000, Explode The Code, Memorizing Colossians 3, doing lots of reading, creative play, crafts, etc.  I'm enjoying working with my little guy!</p><p>I have also volunteered this quarter to teach a creative writing exploratory in middle school.  There are six students in my class that meets twice a week.  I'm really enjoying working with them and teaching them creative writing skills.</p><p>There is a strong possibility we will not be returning to the <span class="caps">USA</span> until the end of May/beginning of June for several reasons - paperwork for James' immigration taking longer than we'd thought it would and most importantly, to help our kids have a good transition from life here back to the <span class="caps">USA</span>.</p><p>Thanks for your prayers!</p>
