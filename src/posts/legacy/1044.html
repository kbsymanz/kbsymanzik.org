<p>I've recently been reading these books and would recommend them to any looking for a good read!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3379.jpg" alt="" width="166" height="244" /></p><p>"The relentless pursuit of high self-esteem has become a virtual religion--and a tyrannical one at that. Our ultracompetitive culture tells us we need to be constantly above average to feel good about ourselves, but there is always someone more attractive, successful, or intelligent than we are. And even when we do manage to grab hold of high self-esteem for a brief moment, we can't seem to keep it. Our sense of self-worth goes up and down like a ping-pong ball, rising and falling in lockstep with our latest success or failure."</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3380.jpg" alt="" width="166" height="244" /></p><p>"In Bounce: Living the Resilient Life, Robert Wicks shows you not just how to manage stress, but how to transform stressful situations into opportunities to live a more meaningful, self-aware, and compassionate life.

You'll learn a wide range of methods--normally reserved for those in helping and healing professions--to help you bounce back from stress and live life to the fullest.</p><p>Bounce shows you how to:</p><p>· Recognize the insidious nature of denial and avoidance as responses to stress</p><p>· Employ psychologically powerful approaches to self-awareness</p><p>· Improve self-talk through the use of cognitive behavioral principles</p><p>· Apply daily-debriefing techniques</p><p>· Utilize a structured reflection guide to uncover areas that require special attention</p><p>· Incorporate silence, solitude, and mindfulness into daily life</p><p>· Stop the drain of valuable emotional energy caused by toxic life situations and unexamined attitudes and beliefs</p><p>· And much more Most important, Bounce helps you develop your own self-care protocol and personal renewal program, based on an honest assessment of your needs, life situation, and habitual ways of dealing--or failing to deal--with stress.</p><p>Insightful, practical, and filled with wise guidance, Bounce shows us all how to live with greater resilience in a world that grows more stressful by the day."</p><p>(information on books from Barnes and Nobles website)</p>
