<p>Today, for our family outing, we went to Outland Adventure to ride the Xcelerator Zip line.  It is billed as the longest one in Asia.<br />It was quite exhilarating and 'totally awesome!'</p><p>The ride itself is about 30 seconds long.  First we had to get the harnesses on, then walk a trail, go across a river on a raft, hike up many steps to the top.  It was really fun and we hope to do it again soon.</p><p>Check out their website on the ride. http://www.outlandadventure.org/</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1672.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>At the Xcelerator, after we'd all ridden.</em></p><p>It is a totally awesome ride and Kirsten and I hope to go again on our birthdays!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1673.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Getting our harnesses on.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1674.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The raft we used to go across the river.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1675.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kurt helping pull the raft across.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1676.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Climbing the many steps up the hill to the platform</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1677.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>A view of Davao and the bay and Samal Island from the top.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1678.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla and I on the platform</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1679.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla taking off.
