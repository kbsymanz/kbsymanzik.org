<p>We are finding out that Jerard really likes rougher textures!</p><p>Today, he played with coarse pebbles during therapy.  He also was smiling and stayed awake the whole hour of therapy!</p><p>He was picking the pebbles up in his hands and enjoying having his feet in the coarse, tiny pebbles while he was sitting and doing other exercise...but he didn't realize he was exercising!  </p><p>It is amazing to watch him be interested and awake and starting to play more.  We thank God for the wisdom and guidance he is providing Liezel and us as we help our little guy grow!</p>
