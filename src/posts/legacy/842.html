<p>A message from Kurt.....</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2739.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>What I learned years ago while contemplating the call to missionary service is still true today - missions<br />desperately needs computer programmers. Computers and the<br />software that we write helps Bible translation get done faster.</p><p>I am currently involved in developing a suite of<br />web applications that allow missionaries throughout Asia to<br />collaborate in teams on special projects.<br />Missionaries are using our software for saving<br />documentation on best practices, storing meeting notes, doing project planning, uploading and downloading important<br />documents, collaboratively writing documentation on all sorts of topics in their field of interest, making decisions with other team members, and many other things.</p><p>I get geeked about software development. Ok, I realize that you just rolled your eyes and yawned ... my kids do the same thing. Just yesterday Ben asked me what I like about writing<br />computer programs. Apparently to him programming computers is only slightly more exciting than watching snails sleep.</p><p><em>"Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in</em><br /><em>whose mind the <span class="caps">LORD</span> had put skill, everyone whose heart</em> <em>stirred him up to come to do the work." -- Exodus 36:2</em></p><p>I consider myself a craftsman for the Lord.<br />In my craft I do not work with silver or gold<br />or cloth - I work with computer languages,<br />network security protocols, and the ever<br />growing list of needs of the missionaries we<br />serve. Just like the craftsmen whom God called through<br />Moses, I believe that the Lord has given<br />me both the skill for the work and the<br />heart to "come to do the work".</p><p>Beth and I would like to thank all of you who are supporting us, both financially and prayerfully. You are partners with<br />us in building for God's kingdom. Thank you for helping to bring God's Word to the thousands of communities of people<br />who still do not yet have it.</p>
