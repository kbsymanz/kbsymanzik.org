<p><em>Grant, O Lord my God, that I may never fall away in success or in</em> <em>failure; that I may not be prideful in prosperity nor dejected in</em> <em>adversity. Let me rejoice only in what unites us and sorrow</em> <br /><em>only in what separates us. May I strive to please no one or fear</em> <em>to displease anyone except Yourself. May I seek always the things</em> <em>that are eternal and never those that are only temporal....</em><br />St. Thomas Aquinas</p>
