<p><em>A week ago today Jerard died.</em><br /><em>Restlessness floods my soul.</em><br /><em>I am up at 3:20a.m.</em><br /><em>James must be feeling it too.</em><br /><em>He is down at 3:40a.m.</em><br /><em>sadness and misery etched on his face.</em><br /><em>He went to sleep last night holding one of the bandanas</em><br /><em>we'd put around Jerard's neck to catch his drool.</em><br /><em>He went to sleep last night asking about Jerard's Elmo and he</em> <em>wants to keep it.</em><br /><em>He went to sleep last night saying to me "I miss my brother."</em></p><p><em>He is restless this morning.</em><br /><em>I hold him.</em><br /><em>His body relaxes</em><br /><em>He sleeps now in my arms.</em></p><p><em>His brother's departure has left a huge hole in his heart.</em><br /><em>How does a four year old process grief?</em><br /><em>How do the restless aches of his heart calm?</em><br /><em>It will be a long grieving and life long missing of his twin.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3098.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>He went to the grave site with me yesterday.</em><br /><em>Sprawling line designs in the dirt with a stick</em><br /><em>He tells me it says, "Jerard, this is Kuya James.  I love you.</em><br /><em>I miss you so much.  See you in Heaven."</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3099.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>and his face registers deep sadness</em><br /><em>then in four year old fashion he is off running</em><br /><em>but not to far.</em><br /><em>He comes back to the grave and says, "Are you sad, Mom?"</em><br /><em>I say "yes I am.  I'm glad he's in heaven and free of pain but</em><br /><em>I really miss my little guy."</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3100.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><em>He says "I miss my brother, too."</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3101.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3096.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3097.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2955.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
