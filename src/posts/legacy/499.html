<p>Tawa tawa is a weed that grows here in the Philippines.  It is also useful for helping dengue sufferers get better faster.  I'm told it helps build up the platelet count of dengue sufferers.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1594.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="194" /></p><p>Our helper, Arlene, has been making tawa tawa tea for James and he has two large glasses of it each day.  He does seem to be helped by it and today his rash is much better and his energy level is higher.</p><p>Thanks for praying for him as he continues to recover from dengue fever!</p>
