<p>We have been enjoying time with friends and family.  Recently Mikayla, Kirsten, and I went bowling with friends from the home school group we had been involved in when we lived here.  That was fun to reconnect.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Mikayla is old enough to start driver's training so the other day I let her practice driving some on Grandpa's farm.  Thankfully he has a long driveway!  She did pretty well, but top speed was about 13 mph!</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Kurt shared at the evening service at Tyrone last night.  His message was on suffering.  It was really good.  </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Today we are heading up north with Kurt's brother and his family.  We will be in Wolverine , MI for four days.  I'll post on that activity when we get back!</p><p>Keep us in your prayers for safe travels and restful times!</p><p>Thanks.</p>
