<p>Kirsten is back from the Outdoor Education trip to Corregidor.<br />The theme this year was "Faith on the Rock."</p><p>She had a great time.</p><p>Besides seeing many sights on the island, the students were challenged to live a life worthy of Christ - on fire for him.<br />They had opportunity to share the gospel with kids at a local school, too.</p><p>2 Timothy 2:1-4, 15</p><p><em>1You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ</em> <em>Jesus.</em> <br /><em>2And the things you have heard me say in the presence</em> <br /><em>of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be</em> <em>qualified to teach others. 3Endure hardship with us like a good</em> <em>soldier of Christ Jesus. 4No one serving as a soldier gets</em> <em>involved in civilian affairs--he wants to please his commanding</em> <em>officer</em><br /><em>.....15Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved,</em><br /><em>a workman who does not need to be ashamed and</em> <br /><em>who correctly handles the word of truth.</em></p><p>We are thankful she is back safely.  It is good to hear her share about what she's learned and seen.</p><p>I'll have her post more about her trip when she's not so tired!</p>
