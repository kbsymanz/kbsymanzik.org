<p>Even for the Philippines it is <span class="caps">HOT</span> lately.....<br />At the moment, as I post this blog, it is 4:15 a.m. and 83 degrees with 85% humidity.  The 'real feel' is 93 degrees.</p><p>It is supposed to get to 95 degrees F today but the 'real feel' will be in the 100's.</p><p><em>"We're having a heat wave</em><br /><em>A tropical heat wave</em><br /><em>The temperature's rising</em><br /><em>It isn't surprising"</em></p><p>http://local.msn.com/worldweather.aspx?eid=8676&amp;q=Davao-PHL&amp;src=Windows7</p>
