<p>I was asked to substitute teach a high school class for a week which I just finished a couple weeks ago.  The high school is located right next to the office where I work.  It is mostly attended by missionary kids.   Our kids will go there when they get old enough. </p><p>The class was on apologetics.  There were about a dozen kids in the class and I really enjoyed it.  Specifically, I taught Presuppositional Apologetics.  This was the first time that they heard of this form of apologetics and they seemed to catch on quite well.</p><p>I based the class content on the apologetics that I taught at Tyrone Covenant Presbyterian Church, our home church in the states.  I taught that over a 9 month period sometime around the year 2000.  Naturally, there was no way that I could fit 9 months into a week, but we covered a lot of ground anyway.</p><p>I assigned them homework and reading each night and we had a test at the end of the week.  I graded the homework and the tests.  So, I was a full-fledged substitute teacher for a week.</p><p>I really enjoyed the experience.  I found myself highly energized as I taught the kids.  We had some really interesting discussions and the feedback that I received from the kids and the teacher that I substituted for were quite positive.  In fact, the teacher asked if I would be interested in teaching a class next fall.</p><p>Which, of course, reminds me of what I have told many of you in person.  Teachers for mission schools are really badly needed.  If you don't believe me, just look at the fact that they asked a software developer to teach apologetics!  Are you a teacher?  Have you considered missions lately?  Teachers for missionary kids are what allow missionaries to stay on the field - think about what an important role you can play in missions as a teacher.</p>
