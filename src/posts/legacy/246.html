<p>Pray for the people being affected by the typhoon that hit early this morning.  Reports so far are that 12 people have lost their lives due to the storm and flooding.</p><p>We are not in the path of the typhoon but are experiencing unusually windy, cool weather and gray skies.  Our work had planned a snorkeling boat trip for today but due to rough seas and threatening rain storms all boating has been cancelled.</p><p>To read more about the storm, check out: http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation</p>
