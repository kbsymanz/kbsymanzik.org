<p>James was wearing his daddy's shoes yesterday.  He is in that wonderful stage of life where his Daddy means all the world to him.<br />He loves to follow Kurt around, play with him.  He calls out for him during the day when Kurt is at work.  It is very sweet.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1483.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p>It makes me humbly aware of how much our actions as earthly parents instill in our children the image of their Heavenly Father.</p><p>I think in hymns and songs.  This song chorus was going through my head yesterday as I saw James walking around in his Daddy's shoes.</p><p>"I want to be like my Daddy (like my Daddy)<br />To walk and talk in every way<br />He loves me more than I'll ever know<br />I'm growing more like Him everyday (everyday)<br />Let me say I want to be like my Daddy (like my Daddy)<br />And it's clear for all to see<br />The reason I want to be like Him<br />'Cause He's so much a part of me<br />I wanna be, I wanna be like my Daddy (just like my Dad)<br />I wanna be, I wanna be like my Daddy" </p>
