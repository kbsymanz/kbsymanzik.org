<p>Friday I went to a traditional market.  What an experience.  Lots of fresh fruits, vegtebles, dried fish, fresh fish, freshly butchered hog being cut to order right there at the stand, chicken, spices...it was an interesting and eye-opening experience.  We will definitely be shopping at the market often.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/10.jpg" title=""Rice and pots at the market"" alt=""Rice and pots at the market"" width="300" height="216" /><br /><em>Rice and pots at the market</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/11.jpg" title=""Dried fish at the market"" alt=""Dried fish at the market"" width="300" height="190" /><br /><em>Dried fish at the market</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/12.jpg" title=""A boy helping his mother sell at the market"" alt=""A boy helping his mother sell at the market"" width="300" height="238" /><br /><em>A boy helping his mother sell at the market</em></p>
