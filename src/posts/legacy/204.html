<p>Today the doctors allowed us to take Jerard home from the hospital. This time he was hospitalized for 13 days during which time he had two operations.  By God's grace he was well enough to go home, though he does have a case of pneumonia right now so please pray about that.  On the way out the nurses all wanted pictures of Jerard to remember him by.  They grew pretty attached to him.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/590.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="295" /><br /><em>James on the left and Jerard on the right.  James is 7.7 kilos and Jerard is 4.7 kilos right now (17 and 10 pounds respectively).  By the way, they are 5 months old as of a few days ago.</em></p><p>Thank you for everyone's prayers for Jerard and our family.  We really needed God's grace and we received just what we needed.  We have been blessed.</p>
