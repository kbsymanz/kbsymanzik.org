<p>Hi All,</p><p>I can't thank you enough for all your prayers.</p><p>I am sleeping and eating better though not as good as my brother.<br />But the doctors are really pleased with how much my head has gone down and that I am starting to gain some weight.</p><p>The nurses weighed me yesterday and I am 4.2 kilos, which in pounds equals 9.24 pounds.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/562.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>A close up of my head....my Mom and Dad call my head a 'shape shifter'...compare my head to the picture from 5 days ago; it's changed a lot!!!!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/563.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Me in bed with Tweety and Bear</em></p><p>Please keep praying; not just for me, but for my brother who has a fever and sounds like he's coming down with bronchitis, for my Mom and Dad to stay healthy, and for my Ates Mikayla and Kirsten, and Kuya Ben.</p><p>Pray also for wisdom for the doctors and my Mom and Dad.  Since I have a shunt in my head and am being treated for meningitis, I need to have my shunt replaced.  I guess the bad germs like to hide out in the tubing away from the antibiotics and could make me sick all over again...yuck.  So, a second surgery for me is probably coming up pretty soon.</p>
