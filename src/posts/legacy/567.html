<p>A while ago I blogged that March was going to be a month of obtaining braces.....</p><p>Well,  Jerard's balance is improving so much we do not need to obtain the <span class="caps">SWASH</span> brace for him.  That is an answer to prayer.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1802.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><em>Jerard 'sits' with his legs under him.  He is now able to sit up</em><br /><em>like this and even reach for objects without losing his balance or</em><br /><em>throwing himself backward.</em></p><p>Kirsten will be getting her braces on her teeth sometime in the next few months.  </p>
