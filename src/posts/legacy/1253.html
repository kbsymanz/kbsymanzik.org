<p>We have enjoyed a nice Christmas and New Year break with our family and friends.  <br />As I've journeyed here in the Philippines, living in a third world country where poverty and need abound, the 'need' for things dies and the blessings of time with friends and family rise important to the top. </p><p><strong>I am thankful for hugs, laughter, time with friends and family....</strong></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4003.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4004.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4005.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4009.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4010.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4011.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4012.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4014.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4015.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4016.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4017.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4018.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><strong>I'm thankful for the fun things I see...</strong><br /><em>like a backhoe being towed on a raft across the bay</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4008.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><em>like the resourcefulness of piling as many people on the boat</em><br /><em>as possible to make the trip across the bay....</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4013.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="216" /></p><p><strong>I'm thankful for car ferries and trips across the bay to another</strong> <strong>island....</strong><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4006.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4007.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><strong>I'm thankful for many lessons learned in giving thanks in all</strong><br /><strong>things that I have learned from Filipinos.  Relationships with</strong><br /><strong>others are so important and joy is abounding no matter what</strong><br /><strong>the circumstances of life are....There is a saying that it does no</strong><br /><strong>good to complain, just accept what is...<em>Maba-badtrip ka lang</em></strong> <strong><em>Pasensya na lang. Ganyan talaga, e. (It will just ruin your</em></strong> <strong><em>mood. Just be patient. It's the way it is)</em></strong><br /><strong>This is good to a point.  It also reminds me of what 1</strong> <strong>Thessalonians 5:18 says <em>give thanks in all circumstances; for</em></strong> <strong><em>this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.</em></strong></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4019.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4020.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4021.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4022.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><strong>and I am thankful for my Saviour, for His love for me,</strong><br /><strong>for time to reflect on His goodness, for the beauty of this</strong><br /><strong>world He created, for the joy of watching a beautiful sunset...</strong></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4023.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p>Steve Green's song, Rest, based on Psalm 23 plays through my mind often.  Times with friends and family, relaxing on a beach, playing games, walking through a village...daily life....no matter what the circumstance...God woos me to rest in Him.....I challenge each of us to remember this...</p><p><strong><em>Rest, the Lord is here,</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Refuse to fear, <span class="caps">ENJOY</span> <span class="caps">HIS</span> <span class="caps">LOVE</span>...</em></strong></p><p>and as Psalm 23 reminds us....</p><p><em>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.</em><br /><em>He makes me lie down in green pastures.</em><br /><em>He leads me beside still waters.</em><br /><em>He restores my soul.</em><br /><em>He leads me in paths of righteousness</em><br /><em>for his name's sake.</em></p><p><em>Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,</em><br /><em>I will fear no evil,</em><br /><em>for you are with me;</em><br /><em>your rod and your staff,</em><br /><em>they comfort me.</em></p><p><em>You prepare a table before me</em><br /><em>in the presence of my enemies;</em><br /><em>you anoint my head with oil;</em><br /><em>my cup overflows.</em><br /><em>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me</em><br /><em>all the days of my life,</em><br /><em>and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord</em><br /><em>forever.</em></p><p>May this new year, 2015, find you enjoying His love for you no matter where you are or what you are going through.</p>
