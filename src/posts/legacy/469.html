<p>Being humbly reminded again how deep my Father's love and watch care is, this verse from the hymn "Come Thou Fount" has been going through my head this morning.</p><p>"O to grace how great a debtor<br />Daily I'm constrained to be!<br />Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,<br />Bind my wandering heart to Thee.<br />Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,<br />Prone to leave the God I love;<br />Here's my heart, O take and seal it,<br />Seal it for Thy courts above."</p><p><em>Ephesians 1: 3Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus</em> <em>Christ,  who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in</em> <em>the heavenly places, 4 even as he chose us in him before the</em> <em>foundation of the world, that we should be holy and</em> <em>blameless before him. In love 5 he predestined us for adoption as</em> <em>sons through Jesus Christ,according to the purpose of his will,</em><br /><em>6 to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed</em> <em>us in the Beloved.</em> </p>
