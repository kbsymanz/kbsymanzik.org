<p>Hi!</p><p>My brother and I are almost one!  My Mom and Dad are having a party for us on October 18.  Our official birthdate is October 26.<br />But we are celebrating before my Daddy goes to the United States for three weeks.</p><p>See how much we've changed since we came to live with our Mom and Dad?  We feel very blessed.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/541.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>I am walking now!  All by myself!  And I love to 'talk'.  I know what I'm saying but my ate's, kuya, and parents don't always understand what I'm saying!!!!  Oh well, it's fun to see them imitate me and smile!</p><p>I clap my hands when I do something I'm proud of!</p><p>Yesterday I even clapped my hands for my brother, Jerard.  (Mom calls him 'Jon-Jon'!)  He rolled over all by himself.  He's doing that quite a bit now.</p><p>Thanks for all your prayers!!!!!</p>
