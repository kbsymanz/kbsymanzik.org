<p>Today, the middle schoolers are touring Manila.  From Kirsten's text messages, she seems to be enjoying the trip so far, though she was tired yesterday from a full day of 'band camp' and a concert they gave.</p><p>The main sight they will be exploring are the  Intramuros, located along the southern bank of the Pasig River.  </p><p>Square foot for square foot, no other site in the country holds as much national historical interest as Intramuros. Even its very ground is unique as it holds artifacts that recount the ages of trade even prior to Spanish conquest. Every single conqueror of this country flew its flag over the Intramuros.

Its name, in Latin, intramuros, literally "within the walls".  This 'Old Manila' is known as 'The Walled City' and is surrounded by thick, high walls and moats. During the Spanish colonial period, Intramuros was considered Manila itself.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1728.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="90" /><br /><em>Plaza de Roma</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1729.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="90" /><br /><em>Plaza de la Fuerza</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1730.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="90" /><br /><em>Manila Cathedral</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1731.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="96" /><br /><em>A typical Calesa</em></p>
