<p>Friday April 11 was my birthday.  I invited some women friends over in the morning for munchies and coffee.  It was fun talking, laughing, and praying with friends.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3799.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p>That evening, Kirsten, James and I attended the sports award ceremony at school.  All the athletes from the various sports teams receive a participation award with some also receiving a special award for most improved or most valuable player, etc.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3798.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3795.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p>Saturday, April 12 I attended a prayer and reflection women's retreat at a local garden.  It was a nice day of worshipping with other women and having time to journal and pray alone.  This was from 9a to 4p.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3797.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3800.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3801.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3802.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p>Ben attended the middle school banquet that evening.
