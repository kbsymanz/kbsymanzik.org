Do not repay evil for evil</em><br /><em>or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this</em><br /><em>you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.  For</em></p><p><em>"Whoever desires to love life and see good days,</em><br /><em>let him keep his tongue from evil</em><br /><em>and his lips from speaking deceit; let him turn away from evil</em><br /><em>and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it.</em><br /><em>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,</em>    <em>and his ears are open to their prayer.</em><br /><em>But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."</em></p>
