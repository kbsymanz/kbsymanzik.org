<p>Kurt is heading to the <span class="caps">USA</span> today for meetings at the JAARs center in Waxhaw, NC.  He will then spend 9 days in Michigan visiting family, friends and a couple supporting churches.<br />Pray for him - for safe travels, for good meetings, for contacting supporters and working on raising our support base, etc.<br />Pray for us while he's gone.  The kids especially miss their Daddy while he is on trips.<br />Thanks!</p>
