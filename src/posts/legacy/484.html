<p>Seems like a short while ago I gave birth to our daughter Mikayla....and now she is 15!  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1537.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla - taken this morning of her birthday</em></p><p>As one of her friends told her, "...half way to 30!"</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1539.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>having ice cream and brownies with friends</em></p><p>Mikayla is a blessing.  She is doing well in her studies, playing basketball on the High School girls team, helping lead a weekly Bible Study at school, continuing to play her clarinet, and writing.</p><p>We continue to pray that  God, our Heavenly Father, glorious, may give Mikayla the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that she may know him better. We pray also that the eyes of her heart may be enlightened in order that she may know the hope to which he has called her, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is like the working of his mighty strength, which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can be given, not only in the present age but also in the one to come. </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1538.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Birthday hugs</em></p>
