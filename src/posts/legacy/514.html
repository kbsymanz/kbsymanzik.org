<p>Today marks the 2nd year since James and Jerard came into our lives and hearts.</p><p>They are my sons, even if not legally yet.  And I am so thankful for all the lessons my blessed Saviour has taught me through them.<br />Our family has grown in many ways, each individually and collectively, in learning to give of oneself for another, to love and to do what is right despite the hardships.</p><p>Kurt and I are collecting the last few items needed to file the adoption paper work and hope to have it filed by the middle of this month.<br />We've been told the adoption process will take 6 months to a year.  Pray that the adoption process goes well.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1640.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1630.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerard</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/515.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The night we received the boys.</em></p>
