<p>Jerard's cultures show that the infection has spread to some of the cerebral fluid in the ventricles (but not the cyst) as well as his urinary tract.  So, the infection is systemic.  The doctors have prescribed two stronger anti-biotics for this infection.  They are trying to get on top of this infection before it develops into full blown meningitus.</p>
