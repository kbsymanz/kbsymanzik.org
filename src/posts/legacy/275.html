<p>James 4:15..."If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that."</p><p>Prior to getting the twins we had planned on furloughing the summer of 2009.  </p><p>Then after getting the twins we weren't sure when we'd furlough due to adoption issues.</p> But now, after weighing all the pros and cons of and praying about various furlough times, we've decided the summer of 2009 makes the most sense.  Otherwise, with the adoption process we'd probably have to wait til the summer of 2011.  We didn't want to wait that long to reconnect face to face with our friends/ supporters, and family.<p>So our plan, God willing, is to fly to Michigan the end of May 2009.  <br />Then we will enjoy time reconnecting with our friends/supporters, family...; enjoy some family vacation time...etc...., and return to the Philippines the first week of August 2009.</p><p>We won't be able to bring James and Jerard with us on this trip since they are still officially our foster sons.  It is hard to take foster children out of the country.</p><p>Please pray with us for the right family / individual to stay at our house while we furlough to take care of the boys.  We have a some possibilities already of people to ask.</p><p>Please pray with us as we make plans, knowing full well, the final plans are all in God's hands....and that's just where we want them to be!</p><p>Proverbs 16:3 & 9 Commit your work to the <span class="caps">LORD</span>,   and your plans will be established.............<br />The heart of man plans his way,   but the <span class="caps">LORD</span> establishes his steps.</p>
