 As I watched Ben gently pushing Jerard around in his wheel chair this morning, this verse kept going through my thoughts <em>"Two are better than one,</em>       <em>because they have a good return for their work:</em>      <em>If one falls down,</em>       <em>his friend can help him up."  Ecc. 4: 9, 10a</em><p><img src="/images/legacy/1431.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Ben is a good big brother to Jerard.  He is a friend who helps him up.<br />Ben loves to make Jerard laugh, give him toys to play with, help him at meal times, etc.</p><p>A special needs child is a challenge, but we feel blessed with the opportunity and privilege of raising Jerard for God's glory, despite the challenges.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1432.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
