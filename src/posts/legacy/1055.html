<p>This is a prayer I pray for my family and children....thought I'd share it with you.</p><p><em>To this end, I pray then always for my family; that You,</em><br /><em>our God, may make each of us worthy of Your calling and</em><br /><em>may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by</em><br /><em>Your power so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be</em> <em>glorified in us and us in Him according to the grace of You,</em><br /><em>our God and our Saviour, Jesus Christ our Lord.</em><br /><em>(Based on 2 Thess 1:11-12)</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="450" /></p>
