<p>We had to take our three older kids to the American Embassy outreach in Davao yesterday to renew their passports (otherwise we would've had to fly up to Manila to do that!).  So, they got pulled out of school to do that with us.<br />Then, Kurt and I took them out to lunch and on a 'Family Sneak' - meaning we took them on an outing and they didn't know where we were going!<br />One of our favourite places to go is Eagle Sanctuary.  It's less than an hour from our home, doesn't cost much, is cooler than the city, and quiet!<br />We had a great time walking, seeing the eagles and other animals, and getting a few things from the local vendors who set up there!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2023.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2025.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2026.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2027.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2028.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2029.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2030.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2031.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2032.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2033.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2034.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2035.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2036.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2037.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2038.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2039.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
