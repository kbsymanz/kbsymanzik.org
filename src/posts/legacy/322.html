<p>December 5th the girls played in a Christmas Band concert at the school's newly finished auditorium/performing arts center.  It is a big blessing to have a nice building for the performances to be held in.  The covered court could be very noisy when raining while the bands and choirs were trying to perform.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/946.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/947.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/948.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>Of course we've been baking and decorating some Christmas cookies!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/949.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>Last weekend we passed out Christmas goodie bags to very poor kids in a squatter area near by.  Our friends, James and Jocy, run a weekly Bible Club for these kids.  They provide an excellent ministry.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/950.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/951.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/952.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/953.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p>
