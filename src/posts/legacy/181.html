<p>Jerard continues to improve.  Tests show that he no longer has any active infections.  We have scheduled the shunt replacement to be done on Friday of this week.  He is having another cat scan tomorrow in preparation for the surgery.  The old shunt will be removed and a new one put in, most likely located on the other side of the head.</p><p>We decided to have this done because it is the most recommended approach to take.  Often shunts can harbor an infection long after the infection has been overcome in the rest of the body.  Weeks later, the infection can reappear because the shunt has served as a place for the infection to grow.  That would most likely result in another lengthy hospital stay, etc.  Apparently anti-biotics are not very effective in defeating infections within shunts because the shunts are not a part of the blood stream.  Therefore, shunts are replaced after serious infections such as this one affecting the brain fluid.</p><p>After the surgery is completed, Jerard will most likely have yet another week in the hospital on a course of IV anti-biotics.  So, we are looking at about another 9 or more days in the hospital at this point.</p><p>Please pray for us.  This hospitalization is very draining in many ways: emotionally, physically, and financially.  We are feeling the stress of both of these hospital stays on ourselves and our family very much.  In the 46 days since we began caring for Jerard, we have spent 20 of them in the hospital with him.  Your prayers are appreciated.</p>
