<p>While Kurt and I were away for three days, Ben and Kirsten were at Uncle Kent and Aunt Anne's house with their cousins, Hannah and Michael, for 'Cousin Camp'.   Mikayla is at Camp Michawana until Friday.</p><p>The kids had a great time doing crafts, playing together, riding bikes, going to a water park and on a pontoon ride, etc.</p><p>We brought them home tonight and they are both very tired, but happy and blessed.</p><p>They say, "Thanks, Uncle Kent and Aunt Anne!  We love you!!!"</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1239.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Kirsten, Hannah, Ben, and Michael at the start of 'Cousin Camp'</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Silly pose!!!</em></p>
