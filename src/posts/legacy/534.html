<p>O, the things you can do with cardboard and tape!</p><p>Today I made Jerard a 'standing box' out of an empty Forex box and another box that was the perfect size for his standing box. </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1721.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p> So he now has a 4-ply cardboard standing box that I fit to be the same height as a side table we have.  It has a wedge in the bottom to keep his feet apart.<p>He can stand, play with toys, fuss at me for making him exercise:)!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1720.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Now, I need to figure out how to build a wheeled standing table so he can participate in mixing up cookies in the kitchen and other things!!!!</p>
