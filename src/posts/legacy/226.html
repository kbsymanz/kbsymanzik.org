<p>The Middle School of Faith Academy put on the play "The Velveteen Rabbit" Friday and Saturday night.<br />It was very well done.<br />Mikayla, along with many class mates, was a tree.  She did great!</p><p>Mikayla has really been enjoying middle school.  This school year she's been active in football (soccer), tutoring, participating in community outreach, the school play, choir, band, etc.  <br />I, as her Mom, am really blessed to see her growing into such a fine young lady. </p>
