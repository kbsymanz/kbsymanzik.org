<p>Sunday we took an afternoon excursion to the Eagle Sanctuary.  It's only about 45 minutes from our house, it is peaceful, not expensive, and 'cooler' than the city! </p><p>It was fun to spend time as a family enjoying nature.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1545.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1546.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1544.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1547.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1548.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1549.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>A Philippine Eagle</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1550.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>This is a banyan tree with a vine growing around it.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1551.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>A pretty flower</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1552.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>a weird seed.

Many of them had native costumes on and were from the west side of the island - Zamboanga, as well as other places.  It was fun to talk<br />with them and take pictures of each other!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1559.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1560.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/1561.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>And on the way home we followed a small pickup with about 4 or 5 people sitting under the tarp and these 4 guys standing behind them in the bed of the truck.  Don't know how many were in the cab!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1562.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
