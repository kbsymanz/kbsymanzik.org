<p>Yesterday marked the 3rd year anniversary of taking James and Jerard into our home.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2142.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p>Anyone who knows me, knows I often think in songs.  This song by Nicole Nordeman expresses some of what I would like to convey.  I am so thankful for the lessons God is teaching me and each member of our family.</p> - Lessons on being thankful even in the dark, hard times -  - Lessons on Kingdom Living  - Building for eternity and not the temporal -Lessons on His faithfulness - ....<p>James and Jerard are blessings in our lives. It has not been an easy transition for our family - but definitely worth all the struggle.  And I'm praying this year we can actually finalize the adoption.  Pray with us regarding that whole process.</p><p><em>Send some rain, would You send some rain?</em><br /><em>'Cause the earth is dry and needs to drink again</em><br /><em>And the sun is high and we are sinking in the shade</em><br /><em>Would You send a cloud, thunder long and loud?</em><br /><em>Let the sky grow black and send some mercy down</em><br /><em>Surely You can see that we are thirsty and afraid</em><br /><em>But maybe not, not today</em><br /><em>Maybe You'll provide in other ways</em><br /><em>And if that's the case . . .</em></p><p><em>We'll give thanks to You</em><br /><em>With gratitude</em><br /><em>For lessons learned in how to thirst for You</em><br /><em>How to bless the very sun that warms our face</em><br /><em>If You never send us rain</em></p><p><em>Daily bread, give us daily bread</em><br /><em>Bless our bodies, keep our children fed</em><br /><em>Fill our cups, then fill them up again tonight</em><br /><em>Wrap us up and warm us through</em><br /><em>Tucked away beneath our sturdy roofs</em><br /><em>Let us slumber safe from danger's view this time</em><br /><em>Or maybe not, not today</em><br /><em>Maybe You'll provide in other ways</em><br /><em>And if that's the case . . .</em></p><p><em>We'll give thanks to You</em><br /><em>With gratitude</em><br /><em>A lesson learned to hunger after You</em><br /><em>That a starry sky offers a better view if no roof is overhead</em> <em>And if we never taste that bread</em></p><p><strong><em>Oh, the differences that often are between</em></strong><br /><strong><em>What we want and what we really need</em></strong></p><p><em>So grant us peace, Jesus, grant us peace</em><br /><em>Move our hearts to hear a single beat</em><br /><em>Between alibis and enemies tonight</em><br /><em>Or maybe not, not today</em><br /><em>Peace might be another world away</em><br /><em>And if that's the case . . .</em></p><p><em>We'll give thanks to You</em><br /><em>With gratitude</em><br /><em>For lessons learned in how to trust in You</em><br /><em>That we are blessed beyond what we could ever dream</em><br /><em>In abundance or in need</em><br /><em>And if You never grant us peace</em></p><p><em>But Jesus, would You please . . .</em></p>
