<p>I was meditating on this passage of scripture today and thought I would share it with you all!!!</p><p><em>12 For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any</em> <em>double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit,</em> <em>joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the</em> <em>heart. 13 Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight.</em> <em>Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to</em> <em>whom we must give account.</em></p><p><em>14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has</em> <em>ascended</em> <br /><em>into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith</em> <em>we profess. <strong>15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable</em></strong> <strong><em>to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has</em></strong> <strong><em>been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet he did not sin.</em></strong> <strong><em>16 Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence,</em></strong> <strong><em>so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our</em></strong> <strong><em>time of need.</em></strong> </p>
