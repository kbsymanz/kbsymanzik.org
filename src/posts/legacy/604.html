<p>Discharge is planned for Friday.</p><p>The reason for an extra day is because he had a blood transfusion last night and they want to observe him for 24 hours.</p> But judging from the noise Jerard is making, he is more than readyto be discharged (and so are we!!!) :-)He's been making vocalizations in response to my talking to him.He is also really enjoying his kamote/banana/isomil smoothies.<p>He has had no seizures for 3 days now. His fever is gone. He is more awake and getting increasingly active.</p><p>His left side continues to be very weak. Which could be from a combination of left sided seizures and the right ventricle pressure pressing on his brain. He has lost some ground as far as motor skills but I think once we get back home and get him back in a routine and daily exercise he will hopefully regain and continue to improve.</p><p>He will be readmitted in about 3 - 4 weeks for shunt surgery.</p><p><em>Please pray with us for financial provision for that surgery and</em> <em>hospital stay.</em></p><p>He will be coming home on two anti-convulsants and a heparin lock for antibiotics for another 3 - 4 days.</p><p>Thanks for all your prayers.</p>
