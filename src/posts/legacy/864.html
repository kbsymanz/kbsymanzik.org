<p>James and I were walking in the cemetery this afternoon.<br />He pointed out to me the pretty clouds and said Jesus was up there. <br /><img src="/images/legacy/311.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />I said, "yes, Jesus is everywhere"</p><p><em>"In my heart, too, Mom"</em></p><p>"Yes, in your heart too!"</p><p><em>"I want to see Jesus face to face."</em></p><p>"When we are in Heaven we will see Jesus face to face!"</p><p><em>"Maybe on FaceBook, Mom!  Maybe on FaceBook!"</em></p><p>I just had to laugh....It was just the soul-refresher I needed to hear today.  Little kids have such simple faith.  I am thankful for the gift of James and his innocent, fresh faith.  He is so sensitive and will spontaneously say to me, "Mom, I love Jesus so much!"</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2469.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p><em>Matthew 11:25"I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,</em> <em>because you have hidden these things from the wise and</em> <em>learned, and revealed them to little children. 26 Yes, Father,</em><br /><em>for this is what you were pleased to do.</em></p> <em>28 "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,</em><em>and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you and</em><em>learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and</em><em>you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy</em><em>and my burden is light."</em>
