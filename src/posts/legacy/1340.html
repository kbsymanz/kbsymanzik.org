<p>El Nino is greatly affecting us here.  We've been having rotational power outages twice a day rather consistently for quite a long while now, usually 1 - 3 hours.  But a few days ago they raised it to 4 hours per time and as of today it is up to 5 hours per time.</p><p>This also affects our water supply as the pumps for the city run on the electric power, so when they are off for hours the water pressure decreases and disappears, then it takes hours for the pressure in the line to build up again.....</p><p>it can be quite frustrating but we have lots of candles and store up water as much as we can.</p>
