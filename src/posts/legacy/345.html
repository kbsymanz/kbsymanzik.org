She was admitted to a local hospital last night with a high fever that isn't going down (104f/40c), vomiting, and diarrhea.  We are still waiting to hear a diagnosis.</p><p>Maricel is a single mom who is going to school for computer programming and works part-time for us to help support her daughter and herself.  She is a blessing.</p><p>Salamat Kaayo!  (Many Thanks)!</p>
