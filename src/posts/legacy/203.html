<p><strong>Thank you for your prayers -- the surgery was a success!</strong></p><p>The surgery took about 7 hours and was done with an endoscope which means that the incisions were quite small.  A shunt (drainage tube) was placed into the problematic cyst that is located in the center of his skull on top of the spinal cord.  The shunt also traversed the back right of the skull were another pocket of fluid was located that needed draining.  Therefore, the shunt will drain both of those fluid cavities.  The shunt was then run down to his abdomen so now Jerard has two shunts that run from his head to his abdomen.</p><p>In addition, another temporary tube was inserted to drain the back left of his skull into an external bag.  The doctor hopes to remove this tube in the next day or two after confirming that the back left pocket of fluid is draining properly via one of the other shunt systems.</p><p>Right now Jerard is awake and hungry though they might not let him eat until the morning (it is 7pm here) because he was anesthetized for so long.  Beth is with Jerard right now.</p><p>Our hope is that these shunts will work as they need to and that Jerard will be cleared to leave the hospital in 3 to 5 days.  Please pray with us along these lines and that no infections set in.</p>
