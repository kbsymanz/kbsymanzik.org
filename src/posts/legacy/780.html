<p>As a mom I am in prayer-mode often for each of my children.  It is important  to pray the Scriptures for our kids because God's Word is alive and active, and accomplishes His purposes in our kids' lives. When we use the words of the Bible as the basis for our prayers, we tap into God's power and align our desires for our kids with God's divine purposes for their lives.</p><p>Our kids have many transitions here; saying good-bye to friends moving away; moving to a different house soon; etc.</p><p>John 15:7-8, <br /><em>7 If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask</em> <em>whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 8 This is</em><br /><em>to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing</em> <em>yourselves to be my disciples.</em><br />May God get all the glory and may we and our kids enjoy fruitful lives that are a million times better than anything we might have planned on our own!</p><p>A great book for praying scripture is by Jodie Berndt.  She has written "Praying Scriptures for your kids" and "Praying Scriptures for your Teens."</p><p>If you think of Mikayla, Kirsten, Ben, James, or Jerard just pray that each of them will grow into the person God wants them to be with a deep passion and hunger for His Word and His way.</p><p>"Father enthroned on high,<br />Holy, holy<br />Ancient, eternal Light,<br />Hear our prayer.</p><p>Lord, save us from the dark<br />Of our striving,<br />Faithless and troubled hearts<br />Weighed down.</p><p>Come, oh Redeemer, come,<br />Grant us mercy.<br />Come, oh Redeemer, come,<br />Grant us peace."</p>     Fernando Ortega, 1996  Metro Music
