<p>This was the group from our sending church who met us at the airport on  May 24th late in the evening.  What joy to see friends waiting for us!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1254.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /> </p> It seems like just a short time ago we arrived.  Now our summer furlough is fast coming to an end.<p><img src="/images/legacy/1255.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /> </p><p>Friends like these and our family here make it hard to say 'so-long' again.  But we will be going back with renewed vision for our ministry, emotional and physical renewal, stronger family ties and relationships, and some of the increased financial support we need for a family of 7.</p><p>We leave Michigan on July 26th after one more morning worship time with our sending church.  We will leave from Texas on July 30, returning to Davao on August 1.</p><p>Please pray for safe travels and a good transition back to Davao.<br />We look forward to seeing James and Jerard again!  We will furlough again when the boys are finally officially adopted and ours!  Then you all can meet them too!</p>
