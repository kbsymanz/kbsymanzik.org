<p>I've been working with James to learn the answers to the first five questions of the young children's catechism.  <br />It is so sweet to hear him say in response to "Who made you?", "God did" in his soft voice.<br />He doesn't speak out the answers to the other questions yet, but he is learning them......2.  What else did God make?  All things.<br />3.  Why did God make you and all things?  For His own glory.<br />4.  How can you glorify God?  By loving Him and doing what He commands.<br />5. Why ought you to glorify God?  Because He loves me and takes care of me.</p><p>Why have I taught all my children this catechism?  To get the truth of God into their hearts and minds, to give them food to ponder on, to turn their hearts to the godward life rather than a wayward life.</p><p>As I was reflecting on these first five questions and answers it reminded me of a story I'd heard of a well-known evangelist, admired for his depth of knowledge and devotion and love for Christ.  He was elderly and ill.  Someone asked him what the most important lesson was he had learned as a Christian all his many years of life.  After pondering for a moment he said, "Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so..."</p><p>These first five questions and answers in the children's catechism and the beloved hymn taught to children are rich in truth and give us much to consider. </p><p><em>1 John 3: 1How great is the love the Father has lavished on</em><br /><em>us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we</em> <em>are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know</em> <em>him. 2Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will</em> <em>be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he</em> <em>appears,we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</em> <em>3Everyone who has  this hope in him purifies himself,</em><br /><em>just as he is pure.</em></p><p>Praying the truth of His love for each of us sinks deep in your heart today!</p>
