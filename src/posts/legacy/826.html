<p>I have awoken with the song "Be At Rest" by Steve Green going through my head.<br />It is good to know that we can rest in our loving Father's hands no matter what storms are blowing around.</p><p>Psalm 62</p> <em>1 Truly my soul finds rest in God;</em>   <em>my salvation comes from him.</em><em>2 Truly he is my rock and my salvation;</em>  <em>he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.</em> <em>3 How long will you assault me?</em>   <em>Would all of you throw me down--</em>   <em>this leaning wall, this tottering fence?</em><em>4 Surely they intend to topple me</em>  <em>from my lofty place;</em>   <em>they take delight in lies.</em><em>With their mouths they bless,</em>  <em>but in their hearts they curse.</em> <strong><em>5 Yes, my soul, find rest in God;</em></strong>   <em>my hope comes from him.</em><em>6 Truly he is my rock and my salvation;</em>  <em>he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.</em><em>7 My salvation and my honor depend on God;</em>  <em>he is my mighty rock, my refuge.</em><em>8 Trust in him at all times, you people;</em>  <em>pour out your hearts to him,</em>   <em>for God is our refuge.</em>
