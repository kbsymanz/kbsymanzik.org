<p>Our dog, Bear, was barking a lot this morning in an unusual bark.  I opened the front door to see what he was barking at and saw a 2 meter snake crawling up the driveway.</p><p>Kurt got the bolo knife and a shovel and chopped its head off!<br />James and Ben were fascinated with the twitching body after the head was off!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3246.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3247.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3248.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3249.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3251.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
