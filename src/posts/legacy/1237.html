<p>Mikayla and I had the pleasure of spending this past Saturday with a wonderful group of women.  This group of women represent 10 nationalities - Chili, Korea, Philippines, German, United States of America, New Zealand, Japan, Northern Ireland, India, and Indonesia.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3910.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="239" /> <br />One thing I will really miss when we return to the states next year is having such diversity in friendships!</p><p>The Prayer and Reflection day was centered on the theme of "Finding A Rhythm of Rest" and the verse <em>be still and know that I am God."  Psalm 46:10.</em></p><p>Resting - taking a Sabbath - is a spiritual precept.</p><p><em>In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is</em><br /><em>your strength..." Isaiah 30:15.</em></p><p>A "sabbath time" is not dependent upon our readiness to stop, but requires surrender.  We stop because it's time to stop; not when we complete our call, check our emails, etc...<br /><strong><em>A 'Sabbath' can be a day, an afternoon, an hour...whatever</em></strong><br /><strong><em>preserves rest and refreshment...</em></strong> (from Eveyln C. Davis 2004)<br />So, turn off the cell phone, close down the computer, disconnect from the internet and spend time alone in solitude and silence with God.  It is very restorative.</p><p>A great book to read further on finding the rhythm of rest is "Emotionally Healthy Spirituality" by Pete Scazzero.</p>
