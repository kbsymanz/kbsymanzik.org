<p>Funny the changes a day can bring.</p><p>Since we moved to our new rental a month ago we started noticing our dog, Bear, becoming lethargic.<br />We thought maybe he was eating a plant that might be poisonious so we moved them out of his reach.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4161.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p>But the last couple days there was rapid weight loss, labored breathing....</p><p>the vet came....</p><p>old dog, tumors under the skin, kidney and liver failure starting...</p><p>we had him put down.</p><p>He was a good dog.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4160.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p>James made a cross for his grave.  Ben, Kirsten and Kurt dug the hole.  I provided hugs, a cloth for Bear's burial.  Mikayla witnessed some of the process via skype from the UK.</p><p>We'll get another dog as they provide good security here.  But for the moments now we mourn the passing of this good dog, Bear.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /><br /><em>Bear as a puppy.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/148.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/149.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/853.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/1028.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/1576.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2021.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2018.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
