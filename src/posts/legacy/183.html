<p>Jerard's surgery has been delayed til Saturday.</p><p>Today's CT scan showed anachroid cyst in the brain. <br />Arachnoid cysts are sacs that are filled with cerebrospinal fluid and form in the surface region of the brain around the cranial base, or on the arachnoid membrane (one of three membranes that covers the brain and spinal cord).  This is a congenital defect.</p><p>So another neurosurgeon who does endoscopic surgery is being called in to assist the neurosurgeon who will be doing the shunt replacement.  The endoscopic neurosurgeon will drain the cyst.</p><p>Stay tuned and please keep praying!</p><p>Psalm 138:8 The <span class="caps">LORD</span> will fulfill his purpose for me;       your love, O <span class="caps">LORD</span>, endures forever--       do not abandon the works of your hands</p>
