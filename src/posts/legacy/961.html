<p>Dear Jerard,</p><p>I miss you.</p><p>When I first heard about you and your brother when you were newly born, I felt a motherly love for you well up in my heart.<br />And when I first held you in my arms I knew you were my visitor from heaven.</p><p>You gave us many challenges and joys.  Your laugh and smile could dispel the darkest time.<br />I learned a lot about cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus and the joy and burden of caring for a child with special needs.</p><p>I joke that I need an honorary nursing degree from all the experiences you gave me with heparin locks, crushing pills, caring for you.</p><p>I'm so glad you came into my life.</p><p>I have missed your voice since March 7th when those seizures took your voice, smile, laugh , ability to swallow and move from you.<br />I miss rubbing noses with you; hearing your laugh; hearing you bang your food tray; the occassional times you'd say 'mama'.<br />I miss rubbing your head, snuggling with you.<br />I even miss the struggle of dressing and changing you.</p><p>But oh the things God has taught me through you.<br />Oh the depth of <span class="caps">HIS</span> love for each of us.<br />Your blindness showed me my own blindness and help me see clearer the love of my Saviour for me.<br />Your helplessness helped me surrender my need to be in control and learn to rely more deeply on my Saviour's leading, love, and plan.<br />Your messes showed me how Jesus loves each of us just how we are.  There is a song by Amy Grant that has a line in it, "beautiful the mess we are; the honest cries of breaking hearts is better than an hallelujah..."</p><p>My visitor from heaven, if only for a while...<br />it's hard to let you go.</p><p>But I rejoice you are free - now with a body that moves, sees, talks.  And I envision you smiling and so free in the presence of Jesus.</p><p>I'll see you again some day, little Buddy.  But for now I am left with an ache of sadness and grief in my heart.  You are dearly loved and dearly missed.</p><p>My visitor from heaven....I send you with a name....</p><p>A gift of love to be returned<br />I think of you and smile<br />With aching hearts and empty arms<br />I send you with a name<br />It hurts so much to let you go<br />But I'm so glad you came<br />I'm so glad you came<br />I trust you to the Father's love<br />And to His tender care<br />Held in the everlasting arms<br />And I'm so glad you're there<br />I'm so glad you're there<br />With breaking hearts and open hands<br />I send you with a name<br />It hurts so much to let you go<br />But I'm so glad you came  (Twyla Paris)</p>
