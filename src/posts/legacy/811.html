Ben made me promise not to do a "Ben Ten" themed birthday for his 10th birthday!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2638.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Ben,  May you continue to grow in God's wisdom and grace; becoming the man He wants you to be; a man after His own heart!  You are a blessing!!!
