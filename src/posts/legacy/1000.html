<p>News from us this week:</p><p>We have had fever and cold-like symptoms going through our house this past week.  I got hit the worst and am still recovering.  Ben missed two days of school; Mikayla missed the volleyball tournament yesterday because of it.  Kurt and Kirsten seemed to avoided it altogether.</p><p>The adoption process is in motion.  Here in the Philippines an announcement regarding the adoption of a child has to run in a newspaper for three weeks.  That 'ad' has been run.  Our social worker is finishing up her homestudy report.  Our court date for the adoption is March 4, 2013.  Please pray it does not get postponed.</p><p>We are planning a furlough starting June or July of 2013 for a year.  Mikayla will head off to college and we want to be in the states for her first year.  There will be many cultural adjustments for all our children.  Ben has lived longer in the Philippines than he has in the <span class="caps">USA</span>.  James has never been in the <span class="caps">USA</span> (yet).  Kirsten was 8 when we came here.</p><p>Pray for us as we prepare for furlough.  Pray for our children as they go through the school year.</p>
