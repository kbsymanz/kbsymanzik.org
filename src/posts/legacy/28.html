<p>We have experienced a great first  Christmas in the Philippines.  It was hot, 90 degrees plus high humidity.  </p><p>We started our morning with opening stockings.  Then read Luke 2 and did the advent candles.  Opened gifts, played a bit of soccer and basketball, cleaned up and enjoyed a wonderful dinner with friends at their home.<br />Our kids are doing well.  Thank you for all your continued prayers and gifts.  Here are some pictures to share with you from our first Christmas here.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/59.jpg" title=""Ben with his new punching bag"" alt=""Ben with his new punching bag"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben with his new punching bag</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/60.jpg" title=""Mikayla with her new guitar"" alt=""Mikayla with her new guitar"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla with her new guitar</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/61.jpg" title=""Kirsten with her new dog"" alt=""Kirsten with her new dog"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten with her new dog</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/62.jpg" title=""Good friend and good coffee"" alt=""Good friend and good coffee"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Good friend and good coffee</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/64.jpg" title=""Gwapo bana - Handsome husband"" alt=""Gwapo bana - Handsome husband"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Gwapo bana - Handsome husband</em></p>
