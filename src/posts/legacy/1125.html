<p><em>O Lord, grant me to greet the coming day in peace.</em> <br /><em>Help me in all things to rely upon thy holy will.</em> <br /><em>In every hour of the day reveal thy will to me.</em> <br /><em>Bless my dealings with all who surround me.</em> <br /><em>Teach me to treat all that comes to me throughout the day with</em> <em>peace of soul, and with firm conviction that thy will governs all.</em></p><p><em>In all my deeds and words guide my thoughts and feelings.</em> <br /><em>In unforeseen events let me not forget that all are sent by thee.</em> <br /><em>Teach me to act firmly and wisely, without embittering and</em> <em>embarrassing others.</em></p><p><em>Give me strength to bear the fatigue of the coming day with all</em><br /><em>that it shall bring.</em> <br /><em>Direct my will, teach me to pray, pray thou thyself in me.</em><br /><em>Amen.</em></p><p><em>Metropolitan Philaret of Moscow</em> </p>
