<p>Every year our school sports teams finish their seasons by traveling to the International School Athletic Competition.  Mikayla, along with the girls volley ball team, the boy's volleyball team and coaches travels to Cebu tomorrow for three days of tournaments with other international schools here in the Philippines.  <br />Pray for safety in travels and playing!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3280.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="265" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3279.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="265" /><br /><em>A fun team photo</em></p>
