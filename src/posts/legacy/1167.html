<p>I have a bracelet I wear that states, "It is what it is."  That simple saying reminds me of the Biblical mandate to be content in all things.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3673.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p>I've been asked about how we can be so patient as we await James' adoption to be finalized.  God has led me on a path through the years of knowing that He ordains our circumstances and there is no need for fret or worry; it doesn't help anything.</p><p>As Jerard used to lean into me and rest on me, my Saviour wants me to lean into Him and rest on Him in all things.</p><p>Two key principles I've been learning are <br /><strong>Being content and giving thanks</strong><br /><strong>These are key to a peace-filled, joyous Christian life.</strong><br />It doesn't mean there are not trials, but we can know contentment in the trial, peace in the waiting and rest in the wrestling.</p><p>Philippians 4: 4-13</p><p><em>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice....do not</em><br /><em>be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and</em> <em>supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made</em><br /><em>known to God....I have learned in whatever situation I am to</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2856.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3644.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="190" /></p><p><em>be content. I know how to be brought low, and I know how</em><br /><em>to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned</em><br /><em>the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.</em><br /><em>I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</em></p><p>As one of my favourite songs says,</p><p><em>"Somedays we forget</em><br /><em>To look around us</em><br /><em>Somedays we can't see</em><br /><em>The joy that surrounds us</em><br /><em>So caught up inside ourselves</em><br /><em>We take when we should give.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3666.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><em>So for tonight we pray for</em><br /><em>What we know can be.</em><br /><em>And on this day we hope for</em><br /><em>What we still can't see.</em><br /><em>It's up to us to be the change</em><br /><em>And even though we all can still do more</em><br /><em>There's so much to be thankful for.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3671.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><em>Look beyond ourselves</em><br /><em>There's so much sorrow....</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3646.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="190" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3643.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="190" /></p><p><em>So for tonight we pray for</em><br /><em>What we know can be.</em><br /><em>And on this day we hope for</em><br /><em>What we still can't see.</em><br /><em>It's up to us to be the change</em><br /><em>And even though we all can still do more</em><br /><em>There's so much to be thankful for.</em><br /><em>There's so much to be thankful for</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3672.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p>I Timothy 6: 6-8<br /><em>...godliness with contentment is great gain, for we brought</em> <em>nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of</em><br /><em>the world.
