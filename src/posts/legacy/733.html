<p>God has been directing my Bible study time to the book of Colossians, especially chapter 3.<br /><em>1 Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts</em> <em>on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.</em> <em>2 <strong>Set</strong> your minds on things above, not on earthly things.</em></p><p>The word 'set' really jumps out at me lately.  Faith and obedience are active.  We don't grow as Christians taking a passive stance towards our faith.  God's word is our spiritual food and He wants us to obey Him.  Obeying His word is like the wise man building his house on the rock.        (Luke 6:47)</p><p>In Colossians chapter 3 there are many commands -  set your hearts..Set your minds... Put to death.....rid yourselves ....Do not lie...clothe yourselves...Bear with each other...forgive one another...put on love...Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts...be thankful...Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly...teach and admonish...singing to God with gratitude...whatever you do, ... do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks.....submit yourselves...love your wives...do not be harsh...Children, obey your parents...do not embitter...obey...work at it with all your heart...</p><p>As I read and re-read and study Colossians I am thankful that God helps me grow in His grace and wisdom.  Sanctification is a life-long-active-faith journey.  It is not achieved in my own power but in  "relationship with the Abba of Jesus, who is infinitely compassionate with my brokenness and at the same time an awesome, incomprehensible, and unwieldy Mystery." (Brennan Manning). </p><p>This hymn sums up my prayer for each of my kids, my husband, and myself.......</p><p>May the mind of Christ, my Savior,<br />Live in me from day to day,<br />By His love and power controlling<br />All I do and say.</p><p>May the Word of God dwell richly<br />In my heart from hour to hour,<br />So that all may see I triumph<br />Only through His power.</p><p>May the peace of God my Father<br />Rule my life in everything,<br />That I may be calm to comfort<br />Sick and sorrowing.</p><p>May the love of Jesus fill me<br />As the waters fill the sea;<br />Him exalting, self abasing,<br />This is victory.</p><p>May I run the race before me,<br />Strong and brave to face the foe,<br />Looking only unto Jesus<br />As I onward go.</p><p>May His beauty rest upon me,<br />As I seek the lost to win,<br />And may they forget the channel,<br />Seeing only Him.<br />(Kate Wilkinson, 1913)</p>
