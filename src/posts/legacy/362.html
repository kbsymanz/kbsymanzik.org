<p>The Girls team are playing well against tough competition.<br />They played two games on Friday, losing 1-0 and 2-0 but feeling like winners because they've been playing well and not getting trounced on.<br />They play two games this morning.  If they win one of those games they will then play again this afternoon in the playoffs!</p>
