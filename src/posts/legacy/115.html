<p>A typical school day starts at 6 a.m. with the kids getting up, eating breakfast, and getting school uniforms on.  Kurt usually drives them to school since the school is right next to the office.</p><p>Last week was "Spirit Week."  The school raised money and took clothing donations to help the many street children here in Davao.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/360.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben in Kindergarten class with his teacher, Mrs. Robinson.

He works from 7:30 - 5:30 or so.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/364.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kurt at the office!</em></p><p>I spend some days at the office and some days at home running errands.  I also take the majority of pictures which is why you don't usually see my face!!!!!:)</p><p>At 2:30 I pick up Kirsten and Ben and bring them home.  Mikayla goes to her Daddy's office and works on homework until they come home for dinner around 5:30.  7th grade is tough with homework.  She usually does more after dinner and also practices clarinet and piano, then goes to bed.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/361.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Playing with two young coconuts that had fallen in our yard!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/359.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>We love getting packages.
