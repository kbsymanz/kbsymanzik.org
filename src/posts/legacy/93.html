<p>Hi,  We celebrated the <span class="caps">USA</span> 4th of July with an American Style picnic of hotdogs, hamburgers, chips, potato salad, watermelon, and brownies (plus other good food).  </p><p>The 4th of July here in the Philippines is known as "Filipino-American Friendship Day".    It is a day in the Philippines designated by President Diosdado Macapagal to commemorate the liberation of the country by joint Filipino and American forces from the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II.</p><p>We certainly are enjoying the many Filipino friends we are making here!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/258.jpg" title=""Our Filipino colleague's enjoying themselves at the picnic!"" alt=""Our Filipino colleague's enjoying themselves at the picnic!"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>Our Filipino colleague's enjoying themselves at the picnic!</em></p><p>Here's a little history for you!</p><p>The Philippines was a U.S. territory from 1898 to 1942, when it was occupied by Japanese forces, and again for a brief period after the war.
