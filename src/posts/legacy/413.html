<p>Mikayla is home from camp and had a great time!</p><p>She said she had a blast which is good since the title of the week of camp we sent her to was "Blast Camp."!!!:)</p><p>She's a bit tired though!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1245.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>Tomorrow we head to Indiana for 2 days, then Mikayla  heads up north with friends for 3 days, then we travel to Wisconsin for 3 or 4 days...then...(want me to go on?  We've had a busy, fun summer to say the least...)</p>
