<p>Christmas Day at our home was festive and fun.</p><p>The kids had stockings to open.  We ate a breakfast of hard boiled eggs and cinnamon rolls.</p><p>Then we lit our advent wreath and sang some Christmas hymns.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/490.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>The kids enjoyed opening gifts from family and friends.</p><p>Our good friend, Beth, had lunch with us.  We had a stocking and gifts for her!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/493.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Here she is helping the kids put a castle together!</p><p>Then we went to church at 4 p.m.  Mikayla and I have been practicing with our church choir to perform the Christmas Cantata "Peace On Earth."  It was a lot of fun and culturally enlightening.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/491.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/492.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Mikayla was one of the banner dancers for the song "Eternal One."</p><p>The cantata performance started around 5:30.  <br />Then our church had a Christmas dinner.  Rice, fried chicken, roasted pig, and many other good foods were served.</p><p>We are very blessed.  Words fail to express how thankful and humbled we are that God our Father has called us into full-time missionary service.....</p><p><em>O Come All Ye Faithful Joyful and triumphant,</em><br /><em>......Hail! Lord, we greet Thee, Born this happy morning,</em></p><p><strong>O Jesus! for evermore be Thy name adored.</strong></p><p><em>Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing;</em></p><p><strong>O come, let us adore Him</strong></p>
