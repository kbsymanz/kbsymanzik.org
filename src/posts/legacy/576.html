<p>Kurt says he hit a milestone today!</p><p>After being here for three years one of the many projects he's been working on is finally on-line and being used by Asia Area administrators in our organization!</p><p>He listed about 5 or 6 other projects he's been working on and how some of them are on hold as he's the only one working on it but he needs to get other projects done first.....</p><p>As he was talking I couldn't help but start praying that more computer programmers answer the call to come into missions.  The need is great.</p><p><em>Romans 10: 14How then will they call on him in whom they have</em> <em>not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they</em> <em>have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone</em> <em>preaching? 15And how are they to preach unless they are sent?</em><br /><em>As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach</em><br /><em>the good news!"</em></p>
