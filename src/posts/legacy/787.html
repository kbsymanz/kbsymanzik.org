<p><img src="/images/legacy/2551.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />One of the problems of being an MK (missionary kid) is that there are many 'so-longs' to be said.<br />Ben and Fernando have been friends for about 3 or 4 years now, but Fernando's family had to move back to Honduras today.<br />Pray for Ben and Fernando as they deal with the loss of each other's friendship.  It has been a hard 'good-bye' on both their parts.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2552.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
