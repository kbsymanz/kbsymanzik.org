<p>My family wanted me to blog about my cook book!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3299.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p>I've gotten very absent minded since Jerard died.  I've gotten quite good at starting to cook and then walking away to do something else, totally forgetting there is food on the stove to be tended.  So I've burnt many pots of rice.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3298.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p>So, what happens to a cookbook left on a flaming burner?<br />Yep, it catches on fire!  The smell of burning paper and smoke alerted me to the fire!  So I'm hoping I can find another copy of this book!  It's my favourite cookbook!</p>
