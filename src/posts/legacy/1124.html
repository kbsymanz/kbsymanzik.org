<p>Kurt has been learning to cook in preparation for the two months I'll be in the <span class="caps">USA</span> with Mikayla and Kirsten.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3541.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>Mikayla and Kurt cooking</em></p><p>He's quite good and we've been enjoying delicious Spanish rice, stir fry, egg bakes, omelets, and desserts.<br />The other day he and Mikayla made supper.  For dessert they made rock cakes.  These are an excellent dessert.</p><p><strong>Rock Cakes - Rosey's Jolly Raspberry Jelly Rock Cakes</strong><br /><em>from the Redwall Cookbook</em></p><p>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus a bit more for rolling the dough<br />1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br />1/2 teaspoon salt<br />6 Tablespoons butter or margarine, chilled and cubed, plus a bit more for the baking sheet<br />1/2 cup sugar, plus additional for sprinkling<br />2 eggs, lightly beaten<br />Blueberry, Strawberry, or Raspberry Jam or Jelly</p><p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.<br />Grease baking sheet.<br />In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.<br />Add the butter or margarine and rub it into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Stir in the sugar.  Make a well in the centre, add the eggs and mix well to form a stiff dough.<br />Turn the dough out onto a floured board and form it into a roll.<br />Cut the dough into ten pieces, shape them into balls and place them well apart on a baking sheet.<br />Use your thumb to make a hole in the centre of each and fill the hole with jam or jelly.<br />Pinch the dough closed over the jam, sprinkle the rock cakes with a little sugar and bake them until golden brown, about 15 minutes.<br />Cool the cakes on a wire rack and eat them while fresh, preferably on the same day.</p>
