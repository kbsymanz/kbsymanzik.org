<p>Mikayla has been doing an independent study this year learning Cebuano, the 2nd largest language group here in the Philippines.<br />For part of her end-of-the-year project she had to rewrite a children's story and tell it in Cebuano.<br />Her teacher, Ate Bebe, got some neighborhood children to come and listen to the story.  Kurt video recorded the story and took pictures.  I provided chocolate chip cookies for the occasion.  Mikayla did really well!!!!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2518.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2519.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><br /><em>Mikayla and Ate Bebe</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2522.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2523.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /><br /><em>Telling the story and answering questions! all in Cebuano!!!</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2520.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2521.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><br /><em>Kurt loaded the kids up in our car and drove them back to their</em><br /><em>neighborhood.</em></p>
