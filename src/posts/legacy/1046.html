<p>Last weekend a big flood affected many areas of Davao.<br />People in the low lying area near where we live were flooded out.<br />Our church currently has 76 families (approx. 240 people) living in the 2nd floor of the community center.<br />Please pray for all those affected by the flood as they clean and rebuild.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3387.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /><br /><em>the river near our home</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3388.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /><br /><em>flooded area near our home</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3389.jpg" alt="" width="316" height="219" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3390.jpg" alt="" width="316" height="219" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3391.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /><br /><em>flooded area near our home</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3382.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3383.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3384.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>friends from the flooded areas staying at the church</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3386.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>the church setting up areas for various families to stay</em></p>
