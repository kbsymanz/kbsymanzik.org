<p>I am really enjoying Ann Voskamp's book "One Thousand Gifts" and also recieveing her daily blog posts at aholyexperience dot com.</p><p>Here is a quote from today's post....something God is teaching me....to enjoy the moments....</p><p><strong><em>"Still unfolding it:  the only place to be fully alive is right here.</em></strong></p><p><em>There are dishes in the sink</em> (and I might add toys on the floor, piles of laundry to fold and iron, clothes to hang on the line, bread to bake, shopping to be done, etc.... </p><p><em>I profane this moment when I don't stay in it.</em></p><p><em>Be all here: and be holy. Because the Presence of I AM</em><br /><em>always fills the present moment.</em></p><p><em>When I am mindful of this moment, the mind fills with God</em><br /><em>and the heart fills with peace, and joy-thanks fills the prayers,</em><br /><em>and isn't the only way God can come to us is through the door</em><br /><em>of this moment?</em></p><p><em>Here.</em></p><p><em>Joy, it's this snowflake on the sill --</em></p><p><em>living only here in this moment....</em></p>    "Wherever you are, be all there."    ~Jim Elliot
