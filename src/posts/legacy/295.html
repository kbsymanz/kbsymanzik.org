<p>It's really interesting to home school Ben here in a third-world country.  <br />Our workbooks and texts assume a western upbringing!</p><p>Ben was 5 when we moved here.  His memories of snow and fall weather, gardens, suburban life are dim dream-like memories he has.</p><p>It was sort of funny discussing our science chapter on seasons.</p><p>Ben's seasons?  "Hot" and "Hotter"!</p><p>I printed out pics of him when he was little in the snow and playing in the fall leaves so he could visualize what "winter" and "fall" are!!!!</p>
