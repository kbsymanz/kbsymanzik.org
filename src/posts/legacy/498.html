<p>James has been running a high fever for the past few days.<br />This afternoon he developed a rash on his face, neck, arms, chest and back.<br />The doctor is very certain it is dengue.<br />So, keep James in your prayers as he recovers from this viral infection.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1593.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James hasn't been quite so happy lately, but he is doing ok.</em><br /><em>The doctor said it's better to get dengue when young, just like</em><br /><em>chicken pox is better to have when a kid.  It's tougher on adults.</em></p><p>In case you want to know more about dengue, read on.....this is the short story of what dengue is from the World Health Organization website.....<br />"Dengue is transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with any one of the four dengue viruses. It occurs in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. Symptoms appear 3--14 days after the infective bite. Dengue fever is a febrile illness that affects infants, young children and adults.</p><p>Symptoms range from a mild fever, to incapacitating high fever, with severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and rash. There are no specific antiviral medicines for dengue. It is important to maintain hydration. Use of acetylsalicylic acid (e.g. aspirin) and non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. Ibuprofen) is not recommended.</p><p>Dengue haemorrhagic fever (fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, bleeding) is a potentially lethal complication, affecting mainly children. Early clinical diagnosis and careful clinical management by experienced physicians and nurses increase survival of patients. "</p><p>http://www.who.int/topics/dengue/en/</p>
