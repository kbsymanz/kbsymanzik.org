<p>Last Friday the Beginner, Middle School, and Advanced Bands played a Christmas concert at Faith Academy.</p><p>We are really pleased with the high quality music program Faith offers our kids.  Kirsten did an excellent job in the percussion section of the two bands she plays in.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2238.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten playing snare drum.  She really does well!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2239.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Concerts like this are great for remembering the Christmas season is upon us.  <br />Next week, the elementary choir is performing a Christmas cantata.<br />Every year, in this warm climate, it often doesn't "feel" like Christmas to me.  </p><p>But we have decorated our house and are in the process of baking cookies, buying gifts, going to Christmas get-togethers (and hosting a few ourselves.)   Christmas carolers have been coming to the door at night to sing.  I've been playing Christmas music in our house!...</p><p>Praying your holiday preparations include keeping the center-focus on Christ!</p><p><em>Isaiah 9:6For to us a child is born,</em>   <em>to us a son is given;</em><br /><em>and the government shall be upon his shoulder,</em>   <em>and his name shall be called</em><br /><em>Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,</em>    <em>Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</em> </p>
