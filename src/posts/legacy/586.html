<p>Jake is a friend of ours and works at our office.<br />He has been having heart trouble and needs to have a valve replacement surgery sooner rather than later.<br />Please pray for the finances.  (In US dollars it's about $11,000).<br />Pray for his peace in all this uncertainty.  Jake is a deeply committed Christian with an excellent musical talent that he uses in leading praise and worship at our office meetings and at his church.  He's a great accountant.  And he's also helping Kurt learn Cebuano.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1844.jpg" alt="" width="315" height="236" /></p>
