<p>As any of you know who follow this blog, I really like the writings of Brennan Manning.  Today's devotional struck a chord with me and I decided to share it with you all.  This is from his book "Reflections for Ragmuffins" January 22.</p><p>Poverty is not just physical - we see that daily here - </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/955.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/952.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>there is a poverty of heart - to be as a child - humble and relying on our blessed Saviour, Lord and Friend.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2824.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="230" /></p><p><em>Jesus, my Brother and Lord, I pray as I write these words for the</em><br /><em>grace to be truly poor before you, to recognize and accept</em><br /><em>my weakness and humanness, to forgo the indecent</em><br /><em>luxury of self-hatred, to celebrate your mercy and trust in your</em><br /><em>power when I'm at my weakest, to rely on your love no matter</em><br /><em>what I may do, to seek no escapes from my innate poverty,</em><br /><em>to accept loneliness when it comes instead of seeking substitutes,</em><br /><em>to live peacefully without clarity or assurance,</em><br /><em>to stop grandstanding and trying to get attention,</em><br /><em>to do the truth quietly without display,</em><br /><em>to let the dishonesties in my life fade away,</em><br /><em>to belong no more to myself, nor to desert my post when</em><br /><em>I give the appearance of staying at it,</em><br /><em>to cling to my humanity, to accept the limitations</em><br /><em>and full responsibility of being a human being-really human</em><br /><em>and really poor in Christ our Lord.</em></p><p><em>The Lord is good to those whose hope is in <span class="caps">HIM</span>, to the one</em><br /><em>who seeks him; it is good to wait quietly for the salvation</em><br /><em>of the Lord.   Lamentations 3: 25- 26</em></p>
