<p>Ben went to bed last night with a fever of 102.  Today he saw the pediatrician who diagnosed  bronchitis and  started him on an antibiotic and some medicine to help with the congestion and phlegm.  He will be home a few days from school!  He's also got pink eye.  He's a pretty tired young man right now.  Keep him in your prayers.  It's not often he gets sick like this.</p><p>Mikayla has a sinus infection that she in on an antibiotic for since Saturday.  She is feeling better and still able to go to school, practice soccer and clarinet, keep up with her studies, etc......</p><p>Keep our kids in your prayers!  Thanks.</p>
