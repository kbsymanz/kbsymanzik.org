<p>Yesterday (Sunday), for the first time ever in his young life, Jerard reached for a toy on purpose and smiled as he did so.  </p><p>This is good progress for him and a good sign to let us know he is seeing!  </p><p>He has also started to 'coo' a little bit when being talked to! Another step in 'normal baby development', and a good sign of healing and brain growth!!!!</p><p>He has another 6 or 7 days of IV antibiotics to finish up.  <br />Wednesday and Saturday he will have cerebral fluid taken out of his shunt to test for infection.  <br />The first sample came back with no growth in the culture.  <br />If the next two come back 'clean' also the doctors will know the infection has been taken care of.</p><p>There is still no decision as to whether or not he needs another shunt implanted.  <br />The shunt that had been put in for the cyst seems to have taken over the job of draining his ventricle system cerebral fluid.  <br />His head is not enlarging since the removal of the first, infected shunt.<br />We should know by next Monday if he will need another surgery.</p><p>Thanks for your prayers on his and our behalf.    <br />These long hospitalizations can be very trying on all of us!  <br />But these 'trials' are also very fertile ground for God to teach us lessons He wants us to learn about his faithfulness and mercy; about prayer without ceasing; about walking in his peace in the midst of storms; about patience; about his strength shining through in our weaknesses; and about his love!  <br />More on all that later!!!!!!</p>
