<p>We just arrived home from the hospital about two hours ago and it sure does feel good to be home.  Jerald came home with two wounds from the shunt operation, one on his head and the other on his abdomen as you can see in the pictures.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/539.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>He is still occasionally spiking a fever and he will continue several medications at home.  We will see both of Jerald's doctors on Tuesday for a checkup.</p>
