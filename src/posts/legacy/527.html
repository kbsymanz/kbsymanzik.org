<p>As I blog this our family is engaged in typical evening activities. </p><p>Mikayla is busy with homework at the end of the dining room table.  She reminds me of my Dad who used to always do his work at the end of the kitchen table. It's just nice to be amidst the activities.</p><p>Kirsten is on her bed in her room doing her studies  or just reading one of the books she enjoys reading after her homework is done. She enjoys some quiet time after school.  Soon she'll be out to talk with us but for now she needs her 'down time'.</p><p>Ben, Kurt and James are actively and noisily playing baseball in the sala (living room) with a nerf ball and using a broken plastic gun barrel as the bat.  Throw pillows make up the bases.</p><p>Jerard is sleeping in his crib amidst all the hubbub.</p><p>I am typing this blog and thanking God for the family He has given me.</p><p><em>Psalm 79:13 13But we your people, the sheep of your pasture,</em>   <em>will give thanks to you forever;</em>   <em>from generation to generation we will recount your praise.</em>  </p>
