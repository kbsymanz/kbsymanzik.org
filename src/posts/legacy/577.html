<p>It's been a while since I blogged!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1816.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla recently was gone for a week for the High School</em><br /><em>Outreach Service project in a town called Tagum.  They helped</em><br /><em>with <span class="caps">VBS</span>, building a building, and planting a community garden.</em><br /><em>Overall she enjoyed the week.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1822.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten went to a party a while ago where she had to dress as a</em><br /><em>gangster!  She had fun there.  It was a murder mystery party.</em><br /><em>More recently, she and I have been painting her room bright</em><br /><em>yellow with purple accents!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1821.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben recently participated in after school baseball.  He also is</em><br /><em>taking karate lessons three times a week.  He really enjoys that!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1820.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James and Jerard are doing well.  James is very active and talks</em><br /><em>a lot.  Jerard is rolling and crawling better.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1819.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Our outside cat recently had three kittens - Mango, Sirius, and</em><br /><em>Killer!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1817.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Flowers are gorgeous here any time of the year.  It is summer</em><br /><em>here and hotter than usual.  Philippine schools are off for</em><br /><em>summer break.  Their school year starts in June.</em></p><p>Keep us in your prayers!  Thanks!</p>
