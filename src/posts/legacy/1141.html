It was very interesting as I'd never seen a hops before.  <br />Hops are the female flowers of the hop plant, Humulus lupulus. They are used primarily as a flavoring and stability agent in beer, to which they impart a bitter, tangy flavor, though hops are also used for various purposes in other beverages and herbal medicine.</p>
