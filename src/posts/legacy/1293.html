<p>The people we are renting the house from for this year have a dog named Dude.  He is a lab.  He was staying with another family but it wasn't working out, so Dude is back here with us now.  This works out well for us.  We didn't want to buy another dog when we plan to be leaving the end of May 2016, so God provided us with Dude.  I'd post a picture but my camera died.  </p>
