 Saturday we woke up to rainy, cool weather.  It is that way again today.  It is actually in the 70's!  Yesterday afternoon it rose to the 80's but still very pleasant!<p>For the first time since living here almost one year, I was wishing I had a long sleeved blouse! (but only for a few moments!)</p><p>We are really enjoying this cooler weather for a few days!</p>
