<p>Our flight, wheels up to wheels down, was about 31 hours.  Of that time, over 25 hours were spent in the air.  We flew from Detroit to New York, then to Frankfurt, Germany, then to Singapore, and finally to the Philippines.  The Frankfurt to Singapore leg was the longest at about 11+ hours.  We flew Singapore Airlines though and they did a really good job of making the long flights much more comfortable.</p><p>The photo is the Singapore Airline plane that we did most of our flying on.</p>
