<p>This year, with turning 50, I decided to make a lifestyle change and eat healthier.<br />I've switched my diet to mostly vegetarian - and try to follow the "90% rule" which means 90% of what I eat each day is unrefined fruits and veggies!<br />It's easy to do here with all the wonderful fruits and veggies that can be easily obtained at the market.<br />I feel healthier and have gotten back to the weight I was before having babies!<br />If you want to read more about the 90% rule, check out Dr. Joel Furhman's book, "Eat To Live" or visit his website http://www.drfuhrman.com/</p>
