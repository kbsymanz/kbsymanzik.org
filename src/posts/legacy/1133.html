<p>Ben turned 12 on August 3rd.  The girls and I called to sing Happy Birthday to him.  He had a great day bowling, playing with a friend, eating pizza and ice cream.<br />Ben is a blessing and I am thankful he is my son!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3566.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3567.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3568.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p>I pray that Ben continues to seek the things that are above where Christ is.  I pray he sets his mind on things that are above and not on things that are on earth.  I pray he continues to put to death what is earthly and puts off the old self and puts on the new self which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of God.  May whatever Ben does in word or deed be done in the name of Christ Jesus his Lord, with thanksgiving.  (based on Colossians 3)</p>
