She spoiled me taking me to Galveston, resteraunts, a beach front cottage on the gulf coast for a few days, etc.</p><p>Now I'm in Michigan enjoying cooler weather and beautiful fall leaf colours.  I've been enjoying visiting friends and family.<br />Makes me think of the hymn "For The Beauty of the Earth."<br /><em>For the beauty of the earth</em><br /><em>For the glory of the skies,</em><br /><em>For the love which from our birth</em><br /><em>Over and around us lies.</em></p><p><em>Lord of all, to Thee we raise,</em><br /><em>This our hymn of grateful praise.</em></p><p><em>For the beauty of each hour,</em><br /><em>Of the day and of the night,</em><br /><em>Hill and vale, and tree and flower,</em><br /><em>Sun and moon, and stars of light.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3607.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p>
