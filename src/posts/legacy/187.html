<p>I have been reading an excellent book entitled "A Passion for the Impossible - the Life of Lilian Trotter."  This extrodinary woman was a missionary to Algeria's Muslims back in the late 1800's.  She was a gifted artist and observer of nature.  She wrote many devotionals based on lessons observed from flowers, trees, animals.  </p><p>I found the lesson she wrote about the 'martens' very apropos to what God has been teaching me.  I share it now with you.</p><p><cite>"The martens have been reading me a faith lesson.  They</cite> <cite>come in flights at this time of year - lovely things with blue</cite> <cite>throats and feathered claws - </cite></p><p><cite>Their faith lesson is this - that their wings need the sense of</cite> <br /><cite>'an empty void'  below to give them a start</cite><br /><cite>- their leg muscles have no spring in them and when they</cite> <cite>perch by accident on a level place they are stuck fast</cite> </p><p><cite>-  poor things we did not know that natural history fact in the</cite> <cite>past and when we have found them on our flat Alger roof</cite><br /><cite>with its parapet protection, we have thought they had got hurt</cite> <cite>somehow, and more than once we have tried to feed them till</cite> <cite>they died,</cite> </p><p><cite>instead of doing the one thing that they needed - tossing</cite><br /><cite>them off into emptiness.</cite></p><p><strong><em>So we need not wonder if we are not allowed to stay long in</em></strong> </p><p><strong><em>level sheltered places - our faith wings are like the martens</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>and mostly need the gulf of some emergency to give them</em></strong> </p><p><strong><em>their start on a new flight.</em></strong></p>  <strong><em>We will not fear when we feel empty air under them."</em></strong><p>Lilias Trotter 30 April 1908</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/577.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></p>
