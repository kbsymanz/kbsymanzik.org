It was great to see a part of the world we hadn't seen before (it was the first time in Singapore outside the airport for Ben, Kirsten, and I).  </p><p>Though, I was not well on the trip and once we got to the hotel I slept white the others did a little sight seeing.</p><p>We are thankful our visas are renewed!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4051.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="216" /></p>
