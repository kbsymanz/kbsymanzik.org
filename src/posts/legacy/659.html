<p>One thing I really appreciate about Faith Academy is their excellent music program.<br />Tonight there was a band concert featuring the Middle School Combined band, Middle School Advanced Band, 5th grade beginning band, High School Praise Ensemble, and High School Jazz Ensemble.<br />The Band director, Nate Becker, does and excellent job with all the various bands he directs!<br />Kirsten plays percussion  in the Middle School Combined and Advanced Bands.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2011.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Middle School Combined Band</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2012.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten and a class mate in the percussion section.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2013.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Percussion section.</em></p><p><em>Psalm 98:6   With trumpets and the sound of the horn</em>   <em>make a joyful noise before the King, the LORD!</em></p>
