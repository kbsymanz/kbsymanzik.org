<p>Well, Jerard doesn't like to do things simply!  He developed a fever last night and has had to stay in the hospital rather than be discharged.  Pray for him as he is having some problems with his asthma.  Thankfully the fever is going down tonight.<br />Not sure how long we will be in the hospital.  Thanks for your prayers.</p>
