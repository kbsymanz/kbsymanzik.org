<p>Ben is feeling beter.<br />Mikayla is feeling a bit better.<br />Jerard and James are doing good.  Jerard is eating much better and gaining weight.  His voice is returning.  It is good to see him making progress.<br />Kirsten is healthy and was wishing she had had a fever like Ben so she could've missed school all week, too!!!<br />Thanks for all your prayers!!!</p>
