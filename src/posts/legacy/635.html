<p>Today, for the first time since Jerard had his siezures back in June, he stood!  And he practiced walking motions a bit!  He was able to tolerate standing and the walking exercise for a total of about 10 minutes.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1952.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p>I am so thankful to God for the improvements Jerard is making in his motor skills with receiving physical therapy three times a week.</p><p>As I watched him standing I started thinking and reflecting....</p><p>He is a strong, tough little guy who's been through a lot.<br />The name 'Jerard' means "brave spearholder, brave spear warrior."  I find that a wonderfully fitting name for our Jerard.  </p><p>He has had to be strong and a fighter.<br />In Joel 3:10 the ending of the verse reads <br /><em>"...let the weak say, "I am a warrior."</em><br />That is what Jerard is saying.</p><p>For the title of this blog I quoted lyrics from an Elton John song.  I am just amazed at all the struggles Jerard has faced and how he has come out strong after each problem.  God has special plans for this little guy, and while it is challenging being the Mom of a special needs child, I can truly say I am thankful he is in our life.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1954.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>"I'm still standing better than I ever did</em><br /><em>Looking like a true survivor,.......I'm still standing after all this</em> <em>time, Picking up the pieces of my life...."</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1953.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Please keep him in your prayers.  Specifically pray that he will regain the ability to suck.  It is very hard to get fluids in him as he does not like to suck on a bottle or sippy cup.</p>
