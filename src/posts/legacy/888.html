<p>Every year the middle schoolers go on Outdoor Education.  This year they flew to Manila to join the Faith Academy Manila Middle Schoolers on a 5 day adventure to Subic.<br />Kirsten really enjoyed the trip.  It is a time for students to learn more about the Philippines, themselves, their relationship with Christ and serve.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2868.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>At the airport before departure from Davao</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2869.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>at the beach - they released newly hatched sea turtles</em><br /><em>into the ocean.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2870.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="533" /><br /><em>On the bridge leading to the school they ministered at.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2872.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>Performing a skit at the school.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2871.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>The group</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2873.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="334" /><br /><em>Four friends enjoying God's handiwork at night</em></p><p>If you want to see more pics from Outdoor Ed, check out my facebook post!</p>
