<p><em>when you walk through fire you shall not be burned,</em>    <em>and the flame shall not consume you.</em><br /><em>Isaiah 43:2</em></p><p>Walking into the kitchen about half an hour ago I smelled gas and noticed the oven was on to bake something but the flame was not flaming.  <br />I had opened the oven door to check on that.</p><p>Without thinking I just pushed the reignite button which promptly resounded a loud <span class="caps">BOOM</span> as the ball of gas that had built up in the oven and surrounding the stove/oven ignited into a fire ball.</p><p>The hair on my head was singed; <br />the hair on my right arm is singed off;<br />my eyebrows are partly singed;<br />my forehead and right arm feel slightly painful....<br />but I am thanking God for protecting me and not having any major fire or burns caused by my not thinking.</p><p>So, I'm heading to my hair dresser this morning for him to fix my hair!</p><p>I've been very absent minded since Jerard's death.  So I am thankful God is protecting me!</p>
