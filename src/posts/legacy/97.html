<p>Well, we finished our training.  It was very good.</p><p>We also experienced many 'firsts' for us in the Philippines....riding a bus for 8 hours, seeing Banaue Rice Terraces, going to a church out in a village.....once we get home we will be posting many pictures.  It has been a wonderful trip.....more soon!!!!!</p>
