<p>Recently, Kurt and Ben attended a Father-son/guys event for Missionary men and their teenage sons.<br />They first went to a local bowling alley that is duck pin bowling.<br />Duckpin bowling is a variation of 10-pin bowling. The balls used in duckpin bowling are 4-3/4 in (12 cm) to 5 in (12.7 cm) in diameter (which is slightly larger than a softball), weigh 3 lb 6 oz (1.5 kg) to 3 lb 12 oz (1.7 kg) each, and lack finger holes. The pins are squatty too.</p><p>Then they ate balut - for those brave enough to try it.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/4104.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="248" /><br />A balut (spelled standardized as balot) is a developing duck embryo (fertilized duck egg) that is boiled and eaten in the shell. It is commonly sold as streetfood in the Philippines.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4100.jpg" alt="" width="303" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4101.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="237" /></p><p>It's one of those strange foods that if you come to Philippines you should try, but not all of us do!!!  The other food to try here is durian!</p>
