<p>Mikayla and Kirsten had a busy day today.</p><p>After school they played a soccer game.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1753.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla (#15) and Kirsten (#11) playing.  Their uniform</em><br /><em>numbers match their ages!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1754.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1755.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten in action.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1756.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1757.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla</em></p><p>The soccer game ended with Faith losing 4 - 1.  We hurried home for Mikayla and Kirsten to shower up, eat a quick dinner......and<br />then there was a band concert.  <br />Kirsten played percussion to help out the 5th grade beginner band.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1758.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten playing snare drum.</em></p><p>Mikayla played clarinet in the High School Praise Ensemble.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1759.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The Ensemble Mikayla played in.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1760.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla and her friend Jeen.
