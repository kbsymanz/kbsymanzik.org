<p>Life with a disabled child holds many challenges.<br />But a joy for me, as a Mom, is to see my two 'normal' sons take such good care of their brother.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2914.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James pushing Jerard in the stroller.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2915.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben carrying Jerard down for breakfast.</em><br />I see both James and Ben growing in compassion and becoming compassionate care givers because of Jerard.  I know that my sons will be better men because of their relationship with their disabled brother.<br />Praise God for His mercies and grace.</p><p><em>2Peter 1</em><br /><em>5 For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your</em> <em>faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, 6 and knowledge</em><br /><em>with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and</em> <em>steadfastness with godliness, 7 and godliness with <strong>brotherly</em></strong> <strong><em>affection, and brotherly affection with love.</strong> 8 For if these</em> <em>qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from</em><br /><em>being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord</em><br /><em>Jesus Christ.</em></p>
