<p>Beth and I want to thank everyone for all of the prayers uplifted for our family.  We have heard from so many of you who have let us know that you are praying for us.  And we sure do appreciate it!</p><p>Beth and the kids have been adjusting well, though sometimes things are tougher for them.  For me so far, the adjustment has been pretty smooth.  Whether tough or easy, I know that God's grace is quite sufficient for us and that he will continue to see us through.</p><p>We have now been in Davao, Philippines for one month as of yesterday.  <strong>Please continue to pray for us and our transition.</strong>  We have been told that we will be in a time of transition for our first year or so.  That is just normal.</p><p><strong>Please pray that we will find a permanent house to rent soon.</strong>  We are staying in guest housing now, and although it is quite sufficient and nice, I think that they whole family will be better settled once we are in a more permanent abode.</p><p><strong>Please pray for our work here as well.</strong>  I started working at my assignment two weeks ago and everything is going quite well.  Although I cannot get specific on a public website, most of our readers know why we are here and I ask that you take our task to heart.  I see the need even more now that we are here.</p><p><strong>Please pray that God will be glorified in our personal lives.</strong>  If God is not honored in what we say and do, what we value and love, and how we conduct ourselves when no one is looking, then everything else is a sham.  Please pray that we will grow ever closer to Christ and that the light of Christ will shine through us to those who do not know him.</p><p>Thank you for your prayers.</p><blockquote><p><em>You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.</em>  - 2 Corinthians 1:11</p></blockquote>
