<p>It's funny how packing and moving physical items seems to unpack and unsettle emotional and family issues.  In the recent process of moving, some family issues have come to light that we need to deal with.  Please pray with us for wisdom as parents in how to disciple, train and encourage our kids; pray for our family.  Thanks.</p>
