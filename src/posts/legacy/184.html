<p>The past three nights I have awoken at 2:30 a.m. with a very uneasy sense of impending doom.  I kept praying, "God, if you want us to have this surgery make it clear it needs to be done.  If not, close the doors to this surgery.  We are just trying to do what the doctors think best."</p><p>God ordained that the surgery not proceed!  The CT scan showed some technical problems with the surgery and three other neurosurgeons consulted by our neurosurgeon did not see a strong case for replacing the shunt.</p><p>So, we brought Jerard home just a few minutes ago.  He will continue to get IV anti-biotics from home for the next five days and we are arranging for private duty nurses to come by the home to administer them.  We also will be seeing quite a bit of the doctor over the next few weeks...but we are home!</p><p>We are not through this yet.  Thank you for all of your prayers.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/573.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James on the left and Jerard on the right.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/572.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Close-up of Jerard's head -- smaller and smaller as the days go by.</em></p>
