<p>Mikayla has a case of shingles (herpes zoster) on the right side of her face.  Thankfully it was discovered within three days of symptoms starting and she is on a medication to treat the virus.  She also has medicine to help ease the nerve pain.  Pray for her to recover well.  She started college this week as well and is quite busy between her studies and her tutoring jobs.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3998.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>Mikayla being silly for the camara.  This was taken a while ago</em><br /><em>before she got sick.</em></p>
