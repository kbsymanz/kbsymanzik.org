He finally, today, went all day without a fever; tho he still has a cough.</p><p>Being a nice big brother he has shared whatever bug that has been bugging him with James and Jerard.  They each have a low-grade fever but no coughs!</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>James has started walking a few steps on his own!  </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The babies are 11 months old today!</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>School continues to go well for each of our children.</p><p>Kurt and I are enjoying our work and are thankful to be on the mission field.</p><p>Thanks for all your prayers!!!!!</p>
