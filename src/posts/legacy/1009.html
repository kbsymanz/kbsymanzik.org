<p>James was hungry this morning.  He had a merienda (snack), then says, "That was good mom but I still have two hunger bars left."</p><p>Knowing he was talking in MineCraft jargon I replied, "well, just play in safe mode til lunch and then we will fill you up so you have no hunger bars left."</p><p>Ben, Kurt, and James are really into MineCraft.  As a father/son project, Ben and Kurt are working on developing a minecraft server of their own!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3300.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>Ben, James, and a friend playing minecraft!</em></p>
