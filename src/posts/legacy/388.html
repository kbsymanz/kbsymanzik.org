<p>We are counting down the days til we fly to the <span class="caps">USA</span>.</p><p>We are looking forward to reconnecting with family, friends and supporters in the <span class="caps">USA</span>.</p><p>We also hope to stock up on some items that are hard to get here.</p><p>Please pray for us as we travel, speak at churches, spend time with family and friends.</p><p>Pray for James and Jerard, too.  Since they are still foster children we cannot bring them with us on this trip.  Our friend and helper, Arlene, will be staying with the boys at our home.  We know they will be well taken care of, but we will miss them.</p>
