<p>May each of us have a worshipful Christmas, remembering our Saviour "veiled in flesh, the Godhead, see...."</p><p>A quote from C.H. Spurgeon....................</p>    "Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given." As Jesus Christ is a child in his human nature, he is born, begotten of the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary. He is as truly-born, as certainly a child, as any other man that ever lived upon the face of the earth. He is thus in his humanity a child born. <p>But as Jesus Christ is God's Son, he is not born; but given, begotten of his Father from before all worlds, begotten--not made, being of the same substance with the Father. </p><p>The doctrine of the eternal affiliation of Christ is to be received as an undoubted truth of our holy religion. </p><p>But as to any explanation of it, no man should venture thereon, for it remaineth among the deep things of God--one of those solemn mysteries indeed, into which the angels dare not look, nor do they desire to pry into it--a mystery which we must not attempt to fathom, for it is utterly beyond the grasp of any finite being. </p><p>As well might a gnat seek to drink in the ocean, as a finite creature to comprehend the Eternal God. </p><p><em>A God whom we could understand would be no God. If we</em> <em>could grasp him he could not be infinite: if we could understand</em> <em>him, then were he not divine."</em></p><p>Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;<br />Hail th'incarnate Deity,<br />Pleased as man with man to dwell,<br />Jesus, our Emmanuel. </p>
