<p>Michael W. Smith's song, "Ancient Words", is a beautiful song that is 'playing' in my head often.  I wanted to share the words to this song with you.  I thank God for His Holy Word and His life-changing Love and Mercy.</p><p><strong>Ancient Words</strong></p><p>Holy words long preserved <br />for our walk in this world,<br />They resound with God's own heart.<br />Oh let the ancient words impart</p><p>Words of Life, words of Hope<br />Give us strength, help us cope<br />In this world, where e'er we roam<br />Ancient words will guide us Home.</p><p>CHORUS:<br />Ancient words ever true<br />Changing me and changing you,<br />We have come with open hearts<br />Oh let the ancient words impart</p><p>Holy words of our Faith <br />Handed down to this age<br />Came to us through sacrifice<br />Oh heed the faithful words of Christ.</p><p>Holy words long preserved <br />For our walk in this world.<br />They resound with God's own heart<br />Oh let the ancient words impart.</p><p><span class="caps">CHORUS</span> x4<br />We have come with open hearts<br />Oh let the ancient words impart</p>
