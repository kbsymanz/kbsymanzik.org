<p>We've had almost daily brown outs this week.  This is a bit unusual.  It does happen occasionally but usually not daily.<br />When the power goes out so does the water!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/75.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br /><em>It's always good to keep some buckets of water filled in the CR</em><br /><em>and kitchen for times when the water isn't running!</em><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Our internet has been a bit flaky lately too which is why there was a 6 day gap in updates.  But this evening it is up and I can post this! Yea!<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />We all are doing well.  <br />Mikayla is in Manila with her soccer team.  Next year Kurt and I hope to be able to travel up there (or at least one of us) and watch the team play!</p><p>Kirsten is rehearsing for a play she is in "Tom Sawyer".</p><p>Ben is working on first grade learning and is a big help playing with James who is one big bundle of 17-month old energy.</p><p>Jerard continues to make improvements slowly but surely.</p><p>Kurt's work is going well, he is keeping up on his language learning, and helping some Filipino friends learn Java.</p><p>I am staying busy with homeschooling, Momhood in general, and hospitality things at <span class="caps">SIL</span> (though I have delegated many of those responsibilities so I can better focus on being Mom to my kids!)<br />I am also heading up the elementary after-school sports baseball and t-ball which starts Monday and runs for five weeks, M and W.</p><p>Thanks for all your prayers!  We appreciate them and you more than words can say!!!!</p>
