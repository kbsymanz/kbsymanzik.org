<p>A good friend of mine wrote a letter to James the day his brother Jerard died.  I wanted to share it with you all.</p><p><em>For James in the Waiting</em></p><p><em>Your brother, the one who shared your blood</em><br /><em>and your facial features,</em><br /><em>left his body behind today.</em><br /><em>(Did you see his vacant eyes?)</em></p><p><em>James, did you know that he left our world,</em><br /><em>where you used to touch him, make him laugh,</em><br /><em>and is now in with God,</em><br /><em>where God can touch him, make him laugh.</em></p><p><em>James, he can walk.</em> <br /><em>He has a new body.</em><br /><em>Jerard can run.</em><br /><em>He is ready to play with you.</em></p><p><em>But for now, in the waiting,</em><br /><em>I'm asking our Good Lord Jesus</em><br /><em>to give you peace and patience.</em><br /><em>To hold your hand, your heart, your strong young body,</em><br /><em>in His hands while you cry, or question, or are distracted.</em></p><p><em>Because when the waiting is done,</em><br /><em>you'll see your twin brother.</em> <br /><em>And, James,</em><br /><em>he'll finally see you.</em></p><p><em>Love you James,</em><br /><em>Aunt Rachel</em> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3173.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3172.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Since James was little he's always been protective and</em><br /><em>caring of Jerard.</em></p>
