<p>Here in the Philippines, if you don't pay your hospital bill for a birth, then the hospital may not release your birth certificate.  We received the boys when they were about two months old but the hospital had not released the birth certificates yet so we had never seen them either.</p><p>The Department of Social Welfare and Development has since obtained the birth certificates from the hospital and we just received our copies today.</p><p>The most striking thing is that Jerald is not Jerald but <strong>Jerard</strong>!  I suspect that he has not learned his name yet but we sure are going to have a hard time relearning it!</p><p>Jerard was born first on October 26th weighing 1936 grams (4 pounds 4 ounces).  James was born a minute later weighing 1800 grams (3 pounds 15 ounces).  They were the 8th and 9th children of the family.</p>
