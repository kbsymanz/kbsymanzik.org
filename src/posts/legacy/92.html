<p>Well, I killed my first cobra today (the picture above is the species of cobra but not the particular snake that I killed).  Now, I'm usually the sort of guy who subscribes to the 'live and let live' principle.  I don't like killing animals without cause.  But when it comes to a deadly cobra that is on the school grounds between classes on the sidewalk, I didn't hesitate to help the cobra die.</p><p>Mikayla and Kirsten and I were walking home from the office today when we ran across the admittedly small cobra that was about 8 to 10 inches in length.  I was carrying Mikayla's trombone case so I touched the cobra with it to make sure that it was a cobra.  The familiar cobra hood came up as the snake turned to face me.  That was when I proceeded to pound the cobra to death with the trombone case.</p><p>Now, Mikayla's trombone teacher, who is also her music teacher, just happened to be sitting about 30 yards away.  So, I had some explaining to do as to why I was pounding the school's property (we rent the trombone) repeatedly into the cement.  My justification proved to be sufficient once we all had another look at the dead snake.</p><p>Cobras are pretty common here in the Philippines.  But, so is sunshine, so we take the good with the bad and give thanks to God.</p>
