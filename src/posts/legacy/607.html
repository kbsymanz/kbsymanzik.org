<p>Many have emailed me asking what's up with the lumpectomy diagnosis for me.   Because of varying opinions on what the lumpectomy results are showing, I have sent the slides up to St. Luke's Hospital in Manila for further evaluation.  I should know results in a week or two.<br />Thanks for your prayers.</p>
