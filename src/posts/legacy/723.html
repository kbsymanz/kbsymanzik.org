<p>Jerard really suffered a major set back in his developmental skills last June when he had his first major siezures.  Slowly, since then he has been progressing - little by little.  <br />Today, he 'stood' in his standing table with the help of his leg braces to flatten his feet and shin guards to help keep his knees straight. </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2324.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p> He 'stood' for about ten minutes.  His brother James played with him for a while, encouraging him to hold his head straight!<p><img src="/images/legacy/2325.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Keep Jerard in your prayers.  Thanks!</p>
