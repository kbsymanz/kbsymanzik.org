<p>Ben hasn't had much opportunity to learn to ride a bike in the Philippines, but here he has picked it up and loves it!!!!!</p><p>We were blessed to find a good bike for Kirsten at a yard sale and to have friends loan us a bike for Ben.  They are enjoying riding, especially now since Grandpa just had new asphalt put on the drive way!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1244.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1243.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1242.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p>
