<p>It was 89 degrees today, humid and very hot.  We have heard this is the cooler season but we've not felt that to be so ourselves.  Yet, for filipinos, we are coming into the cool season.</p><p>Case in point, I was shopping at SM mall looking for Christmas gifts for Kurt.  A sales clerk said, "Would you like to get jacket for husband?"  I said, "No thanks, it is hot here."  He smiled and said, "Us Filipinos get cold in December." </p>
