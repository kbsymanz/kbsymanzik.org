<p>Yesterday our mission group had a day trip to snorkel and spend time at the beach. <br />When we arrived at the dock we noticed the sea was rough. <br />Kurt was in the boat about 5 minutes and said he couldn't go the rest of the day because of all the waves.  So he stayed home.<br />It was a very rough, wavy ride on the way out to the first snorkel stop.</p><p>A few people, including Ben and Mikayla, got sea sick.</p><p>But after the first snorkel stop people were feeling better.  <br />We all had a great day even if the weather was stormy.</p><p>It wasn't until I got home last night and searched news on the internet that I found out while we were in Davao Bay boating a typhoon was hitting Luzon (the island Manila is on).</p><p>Praise God for His protection.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1459.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Our group on the boat</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1460.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Joel and Ben hanging on to the pole on the ride out to keep balance</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1461.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Stormy seas....</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1462.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla and Kristi enjoying the water.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1463.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Enjoying the waves</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1464.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Stormy Seas</em></p><p>Needless to say, a few times as we were traveling across the bay the hymn line "...when sorrows like sea billows roll....." went through my head.
