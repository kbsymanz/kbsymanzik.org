<p>Jerard's wheelchair will return to the foundation that donated it to us so another child can use it.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2944.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Jerard's strollers have gone to Mercy Maternity Clinic for some poorer Filipino moms to use for their newborns.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2527.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p>Elmo, Jerard's hankerchiefs and one or two toys that seemed to hold his interest are being kept here for safe keeping.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/857.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br />Not only is my heart letting go of my son,<br />our house is letting go of tangibles so others can be blessed by them.<br />Yet a tearing happens at the sight of the wheelchair going to storage, at the sight of the strollers leaving the gate for the last time.</p><p>And my heart grieves.</p><p>I am thankful Jerard is free from pain and a body that wasn't working for him.<br />I miss rubbing his head, rubbing his arms and legs, holding him...</p><p>Grieving takes time<br />and I press on in my Saviour's love</p><p><em>Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am in distress;</em>     <em>my eye is wasted from grief;</em>    <em>my soul and my body also.</em><br /><em>for my life is spent with sorrow,</em>   <em>and my years with sighing;</em><br /><em>my strength fails...</em>    <em>and my bones waste away.</em><br /><em>I trust in you, O Lord;</em>    _I say, "You are my God."<br /><em>.....My times are in your hand;  The Lord preserves the</em><br /><em>faithful but abundantly repays the one who acts in pride.</em><br /><em>.....Be strong, and let your heart take courage,</em>    <em>all you who wait for the Lord!</em><br /><cite>excerpts from Psalm 31</cite></p>
