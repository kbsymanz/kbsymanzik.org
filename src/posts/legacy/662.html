<p>Last night we received a call from our foster care social worker that James and Jerard have been declared legally available for adoption.  <br />So now we can start the process of collecting the paperwork needed to file for adoption of James and Jerard.  <br />Pray that this process will go smoothly.  Thanks!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2040.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>In our hearts James and Jerard are our sons already.  It will be great when</em><br /><em>within the next 12 months or so they become legally our sons!</em></p>
