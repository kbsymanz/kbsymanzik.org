<p>Well, Jerard had been seeming to make progress and there had been talk of sending him home today; <span class="caps">BUT</span><br />over night he developed high fever again, trouble breathing, much congestion.<br />He has what is known as progressive pneumonia.  They will be starting him on a different antibiotic today.<br />Needless to say, he's not being discharged today.<br />Keep him in your prayers!<br />Thanks!!!!</p>
