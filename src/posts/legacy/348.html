I answered.</p><p>"Of all our family you'll be the first one to go to Heaven and see Jesus!"</p><p>"How do you know that?" I said with a smile and a heart that was melting with happiness at his passion for Christ and spending eternity in Heaven.</p><p>"Because you are the oldest and the tallest of us all!"</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1035.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><em>Duet. 29:29The secret things belong to the <span class="caps">LORD</span> our God, but the</em> <em>things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we</em> <em>may follow all the words of this law.</em></p><p><strong>Psalm 139:16 All the days ordained for me</strong>       <strong>were written in your book</strong>       <strong>before one of them came to be.</strong></p>
