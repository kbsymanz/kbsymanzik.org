<p>A really neat place to visit within an hour from where we live is the Philippine Eagle Sanctuary.  </p><p>The Philippine Eagle is a beautiful bird.</p><p>It is one of the rarest, largest and most powerful birds in the world.   This bird of prey belongs to the family Accipitridae.   It is also known as Haribon or Haring Ibon, meaning "Bird King."</p><p>This eagle's head is adorned with long brown feathers that give it the appearance of a lion's mane. It's upperside is brown, the underside white. </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/348.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Philippine Eagle</em></p><p>An average female is about 1 meter (3.3 feet) long, weighs about 7 kg (15.5 lb), and has a wingspan of 2 meters (6.7 feet). This makes the Philippine Eagle one of the world's largest eagles with the largest wing surface area. </p><p>An adult male is about 10-20% smaller and averages at about 5 kg (11 lbs). The life expectancy for the Philippine Eagle is around 30-60 years.</p><p>The Philippine Eagle can be found in rainforests of four major Philippine islands - Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao.</p><p>A really interesting fact is that most eagles are monogamous! A couple remains together for a lifetime.   </p>
