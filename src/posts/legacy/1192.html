<p>I am really blessed by Ken Boa's ministry, daily scripture meditations, and the book he wrote "Conformed To His Image."</p><p>I found March 11th's reading really relavent as I pray for James's adoption to be completed.  Specifically we are waiting for the judge to issue his decision on the adoption.  It has been three months since the last court date.  We've been told this judge can take "a long time" to decide.  I am praying God moves him to issue his approval of the adoption soon.</p><p>I wanted to share March 11th's daily scripture meditation email I receive with you all.  I hope you find blessing and peace as you pray and meditate on God's word.</p><p>kenboa.org</p><p><strong>Daily Growth</strong></p><p>Daily Growth for March 11, 2014<br />Daily Scripture<br />Jonah and the promises of God</p><p>Promises of God in Each Book</p>    "In my distress I called to the Lord, and he answered me.
