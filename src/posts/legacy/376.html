<p>As Kurt blogged yesterday, "The little squatter area behind our house is home to about 50 people who use wood or sawdust to cook with, live in houses constructed out of spare plywood, boards, tin, canvas, or whatever and which vary in dimensions from the size of a walk-in closet to a bedroom in the states. Some are built on stilts and some have a second story."</p><p>Here are a few pictures:</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1101.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1100.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1102.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
