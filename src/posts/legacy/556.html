<p>A while ago I posted that I was going on a women's retreat.<br />It was a great time of refreshing.  A much needed break...quiet time ...fellowship time...drink of cool water to a parched soul.  I thank God for the opportunity to attend and stay overnight there.</p><p>Psalm 46 <em>1 God is our refuge and strength,</em>       <em>an ever-present help in trouble.</em>  <em>2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way</em>       <em>and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,</em></p> <em>3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake</em> <em>with their surging. Selah  4 There is a river whose streams</em> <em>make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High</em> <em>dwells.</em><p><em>5 God is within her, she will not fall;God will help her at break</em> <em>of day.  6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his</em> <em>voice, the earth melts.  7The <span class="caps">LORD</span> Almighty is with us;</em><br /><em>the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah</em></p><p><em>8 Come and see the works of the <span class="caps">LORD</span>, the desolations he</em><br /><em>has brought on the earth. 9 He makes wars cease to the ends</em> <em>of the earth;he breaks the bow and shatters the spear,</em><br /><em>he burns the shields with fire.  10 "Be still, and know that I am</em> <em>God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in</em> <em>the earth."</em></p> <em>11 The <span class="caps">LORD</span> Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our</em> <em>fortress. Selah</em><p>Pictures from the Women's Retreat weekend</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1784.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Our group after the Sunday morning worship time.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1786.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>We had beautiful views up at Mount Hope Retreat Center.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1782.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The dorm we slept in.
