<p>The day Kurt, Mikayla, Ben, and James came to pick Kirsten and I up from our retreat, we headed off for a short family vacation to Eden Nature Park.  It was our respite before this week in which we are now busy packing, painting the new rental, and moving into by July 1!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2559.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2560.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2561.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2562.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2563.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2564.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2565.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2566.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2567.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Jerard stayed at home with Arlene.  He tends to throw many seizures when out of his own familiar environment, so we've found it best to leave him in his comfort zone.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2568.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
