<p>Well, I can't speak about all Thanksgiving in the Philippines, especially since it is a US holiday, but I can speak about how we spent our Thanksgiving about 24 hours after arriving from the US.  <strong>We could hardly keep our eyes open due to jetlag!</strong>  </p><p>Yet, we were treated to a great Thanksgiving meal from some new friends over here, and though we did not fall asleep in our food, we probably came close.  But Ben did not even make it through his meal.</p>
