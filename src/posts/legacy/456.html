<p>The High School Staff had a "Staff Serving Students" banquet Saturday night.  The kids were told to dress in 1960's fashion and bring a car from that era to the '1960's drive-in' themed banquet.<br />Mikayla wore bell bottoms, a 'hippy top' and had beads in her hair!<br />She enjoyed the banquet very much.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1429.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Hippie Mikayla!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1430.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kristi, Lindsay, and Mikayla ready for the banquet.</em><br /><em>We are blessed with two other missionary families living on the</em><br /><em>same street we do with children attending Faith, also!</em><br /><em>On school days, Kurt walks 5 Faith Academy students to school!</em></p>
