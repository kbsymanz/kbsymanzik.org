<p>Today, August 3rd, is Ben's birthday!  He has welcomed in his birthday day by having an all-night Lord of the Rings movie marathon with friends.  As I write this, 7a our time, the friends and Ben are tired and giddy - soon to disperse to homes and beds!  </p><p>We will have a family party tonight for Ben.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4168.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /><br />Ben is growing in to a fine young Christian man.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/4176.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="223" /></p><p>Ben, may you continue to grow in wisdom and grace, following Christ all the days of your life.  You are a blessing!</p><p>Love, Mom</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4177.jpg" alt="" width="166" height="244" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4178.jpg" alt="" width="134" height="244" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4179.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="248" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4180.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /></p>
