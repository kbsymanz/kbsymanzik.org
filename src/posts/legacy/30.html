<p><txp:article_image /><br />Hot water is not a given here in the Philippines.  Most showers (at least for expats) will have a heating unit on the wall that the water runs through to heat up.  (Notice the word 'most'.)  <br />Another thing that is not a given here is good water pressure.<br />Most showers are also equipped with a bucket of water and a dipper for rinsing off just in case the water decides to stop running!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/75.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br />The kitchen sink water is not heated. </p>
