<p>I (Beth) am in the <span class="caps">USA</span> again for a few weeks to do some partnership development and spend time with Mikayla during her fall break and Thanksgiving break.<br />Currently I am in Houston visiting one of my sisters and will be heading up to Michigan on October 6th. <br />I look forward to time with friends and family!</p>
