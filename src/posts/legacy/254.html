<p>Beth Mari was born early this morning (midnight to be exact)<br />to our dear friends Jocy and James.<br />Beth Mari measured 50 cm long (19.7 inches)  and weighed in at 2.95 kilos (6.5 pounds).</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/739.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>It is quite the humbling honor to have friends name their child after me.  Her first name is in my honor; her second name is in honor of Jocy's dear friend MariLyn (who also happens to be Jocy's OB doctor and both our <span class="caps">GYN</span> doctora!)  </p><p>Both Mom and Baby are doing fine though Beth does have a slight infection of some kind and is on an antibiotic for that.  She may be in the hospital a few days due to that.</p><p>Please keep them in your prayers.</p><p>Psalm 127:3Behold, children are a heritage from the <span class="caps">LORD</span>,<br />the fruit of the womb a reward.<br />4Like arrows in the hand of a warrior<br />are the children of one's youth.</p><p>hmmm....Now I'll have much fun buying baby clothes for her!!!!!</p>
