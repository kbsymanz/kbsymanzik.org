But He rides every red-nosed reindeer,</em><br /><em>lurks behind every Cabbage Patch doll, resonates in the most</em><br /><em>desacralized "season's greetings."  Remotely or proximately,</em><br /><em>He is toasted in every cup of Christmas cheer.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1735.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228" /></p><p><em>Each sprig of holly is a hint of His Holiness, each cluster of</em><br /><em>mistletoe a sign He is here.</em></p><p><em>For those who claim His name, Christmas heralds this</em><br /><em>luminous truth:  The God of Jesus Christ is our absolute future.</em></p><p><em>Such is the deeply hopeful character of this sacred season.</em><br /><em>By God's free doing in Bethlehem, nothing can separate us</em><br /><em>from the love of God in Christ Jesus.</em></p><p><em>Light, life, and love are on our side.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4208.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="104" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/455.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4209.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="205" /><br /><em>The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son,</em><br /><em>and they will call Him Immanuel - which means, "God with us."</em><br />Matthew 1:23</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/464.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>from:  Manning, Brennan.
