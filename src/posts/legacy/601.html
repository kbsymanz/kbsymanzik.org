<p>Just for a change of pace in our blog I thought I'd put a few photos in of a project that is on hold for now.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1862.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>I'm hoping to repaint the kitchen in a more coffee shop motif. </p> I have arranged empty starbucks bags of coffee, mugs, and a coffee maker that no longer works on top of the cabinets to be part of this redecorating!  <p><img src="/images/legacy/1863.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>After Jerard gets out of the hospital we may get to the painting!</p>
