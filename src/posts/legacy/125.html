<p>It's amazing what 2 scooters, a water hose, and lollipops do for building friendships!</p><p>This past weekend Ben went outside our gate and started playing with the neighbor kids who live next to us in a squatter area. </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/392.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>These kids are a lot of fun.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/391.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>They really enjoy using Ben's scooter and they love for me to water them with the hose.</p><p>We are praying to continue building friendships with our neighbors!!</p>
