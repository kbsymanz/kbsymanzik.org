<p>Life can take interesting twists and turns in many ways....</p><p>one twist we are dealing with right now is that it appears Mikayla's clarinet has been stolen......</p><p>Please pray for us to either find her clarinet or have the means to replace it for her.  She really is a gifted player and it is quite disappointing that her clarinet has disappeared....</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1066.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Thanks for praying......</p>
