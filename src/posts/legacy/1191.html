<p>Kurt and James had gone to a local mall to get a <span class="caps">DVD</span> on Sunday afternoon.  The parking garage was full and as they drove around looking for a spot to park in, their car and another car met at a intersection......<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3752.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /><br />and......</p><p>ooopss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Thankfully, no one was hurt.<br />Both cars had damage, ours worse than the larger truck.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3753.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3754.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /><br /><em>the car is not driveable so several guys helped push it out of</em><br /><em>the parking garage so that the tow truck could hook it up.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3755.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /><br /><em>We had the car towed back to our house for now.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3756.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /><br /><em>It's a 16 year old car and not worth much.  We are deciding</em><br /><em>about having an estimate done to see if it's worth fixing.</em><br /><em>We had been planning to sell it soon anyway.   Public transpor-</em><br /><em>tation is readily available (taxis, jeepneys, trykes) so we really</em><br /><em>don't need to have our own car.</em></p>
