<p>There are many transitions coming up and already occuring in our family with our upcoming furlough, Mikayla going to college, returning to what now seems like a semi-foreign culture of the <span class="caps">USA</span>, leaving friends, etc.</p><p>There is a huge unknown of how long the finalization of James' adoption will take and what that means for us as a family anticipating leaving the Philippines in June to return to the <span class="caps">USA</span> to help Mikayla settle in to college.</p><p>There are some other issues going on as well that we are working on individually and as a family.</p><p>While we do not know how all these things will work out, we do know the One who is working all these things for our good and His glory.<br />Please pray for each of our children: Mikayla, Kirsten, Ben, and James.  We covet your prayers for each of them and for us.  Thanks!</p>
