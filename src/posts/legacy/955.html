<p>One of the summer goals, even prior to Jerard's death, was for Kurt to teach Mikayla, Kirsten, and Ben computer programming.  They enjoyed their first lesson!  More lessons coming up!<br />We are also working on cooking skills and piano skills this summer!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3114.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3115.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
