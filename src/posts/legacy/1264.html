<p>Psalm 146: 1-2 declares <em>"Praise the Lord!</em><br /><em>Praise the Lord, O my soul!</em> <em>I will praise the Lord as long as I live;</em>    <em>I will sing praises to my God while I have my being."</em></p><p>A while ago I challenged each of my family members to list at least three things they are thankful for each day.</p><p>Today, I am thankful for a quiet Sunday morning, good praise and worship music, and FaceBook that helps me stay connected with friends around the world.</p>
