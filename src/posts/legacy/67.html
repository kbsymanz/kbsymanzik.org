<p>Hi!  I have accepted the assignment of Guest House Manager and Hospitality Coordinator.  (That is actually 2 differing positions that I am fulfilling.)  I am in charge of managing the reservations and staff for the Guest House and also arranging hospitality for those who need it, i.e., new missionaries moving over here, visitors from various missionary support agencies, etc....</p><p>I look forward to this ministry opportunity and thank God for it.  This is a great position as it does not interfere with tending to the needs of my family first and foremost.</p><p>1 Peter 4: 9Show hospitality to one another without grumbling. 10As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace:</p>
