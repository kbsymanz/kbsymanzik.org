<p>As many of you know, Jerard has been sick and was in the hospital for 8 days.  Even though he is home he is still very sick and running fever.</p><p>At times I've been asked what I think of Jerard being in our family; if I have regrets that we ever took him in to care for him....in response to that, I offer the following:</p><p><em>The <span class="caps">GIFT</span> of JERARD</em></p><p><em>Our son struggles for air</em><br /><em>nebulizing every two hours</em><br /><em>his little body quivers</em><br /><em>arm shakes</em><br /><em>will he be alright?</em></p><p><em>Or is this his pathway to Jesus' arms?</em><br /><em>I know not.</em></p><p><em>I awaken at 2a.m.</em><br /><em>More meds to deliver</em><br /><em>Feeding</em><br /><em>Change diaper.</em><br /><em>Nebulize</em><br /><em>Pray</em><br /><em>His life is precious to me</em><br /><em>The gift of his 'special needs' irons of fire Christ is using to mold</em><br /><em>me into <span class="caps">HIS</span> image</em><br /><em>and I thank God for this gift</em><br /><em>I thank God for the gift of Jerard</em></p><p><em>I pray again that I will continue to grow in patience and all that</em><br /><em>God wants for me</em><br /><em>I pray for our family, for unity, for building each other up in love.</em></p><p><em>The road for the past four plus years has been hard</em><br /><em>steep</em><br /><em>strewn with anger, hurt, tears, depression...</em><br /><em>strewn with conflict, sullen silences</em><br /><em>and yet overarching, God's mercy.</em><br /><em>His grace.</em><br /><em>Even in the darkness of soul and family life</em><br /><em>His light shining through</em><br /><em>His love lighting a pathway of healing - personally,</em><br /><em>relationally...</em><br /><em>I see each of us growing</em><br /><em>I see light shining</em><br /><em>I hear more laughter</em><br /><em>I hear more building up words</em><br /><em>We are each growing</em><br /><em>I see tenderness...towards our special gift of Jerard</em><br /><em>I see patience growing in all of us</em><br /><em>and I thank my <span class="caps">ABBA</span> <span class="caps">FATHER</span> for <span class="caps">HIS</span> <span class="caps">LOVE</span>, <span class="caps">MERCY</span>, GRACE</em><br /><em>ever drawing each of us closer to <span class="caps">HIM</span>.</em></p><p><em>This gift,</em><br /><em>Jerard,</em><br /><em>our special needs son</em><br /><em>His neediness is the gift</em><br /><em>His cute smile,</em><br /><em>His gentle blind eyes</em></p><p><em>People wonder why we'd ever take a special needs kid in in the</em><br /><em>first place</em><br /><em>let's just say 'ignorance is bliss"</em><br /><em>we didn't know what we were getting in for when we took</em><br /><em>James and Jerard</em><br /><em>and like I've said</em><br /><em>it's been a hard road</em><br /><em>but a road full of mercy</em><br /><em>a road leading me closer to my FATHER's love</em><br /><em>a road leading our family closer to <span class="caps">HIM</span> and to each other</em><br /><em>a road I do not regret traveling</em><br /><em>inspite of all the travail</em><br /><em>Jerard,</em><br /><em>a gift.</em></p><p><em>He's sleeping peaceful at the moment.</em><br /><em>Fever of night gone.</em><br /><em>Phenobarbital and keppra coursing through his body,</em><br /><em>inducing sleep</em><br /><em>slowing down seizure pathways</em><br /><em>Three antibiotics fighting off infections</em><br /><em>and yet he still runs fever.</em></p><p><em>And all I know is that all is grace</em><br /><em>And my <span class="caps">FATHER</span> knows what lies ahead</em><br /><em>I rest in <span class="caps">HIS</span> loving arms</em><br /><em>Thanking <span class="caps">HIM</span> for <span class="caps">HIS</span> gift,</em><br /><em>Thanking Him for Jerard.</em><br /><em>Amen and Amen.</em></p><p><em>3/17/12 - thoughts from my morning walk</em></p>
