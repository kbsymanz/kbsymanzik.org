This is his 2nd blood transfusion this week.<br />-pray we can still be discharged tomorrow from the hospital<br />it is terribly trying on the whole family to have a member of our family in the hospital.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Psalm 86<br />A prayer of David. <em>1 Hear, O <span class="caps">LORD</span>, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.</em><br /><em>2 Guard my life, for I am devoted to you.</em><br /><em>You are my God; save your servant who trusts in you.</em></p><p><em>3 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I call to you all day long.</em></p><p><em>4 Bring joy to your servant, for to you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.</em></p><p><em>5 You are forgiving and good, O Lord, abounding in love to all who</em> <em>call to you.</em></p><p><em>6 Hear my prayer, O LORD; listen to my cry for mercy.</em></p><p><em>7 In the day of my trouble I will call to you,</em>   <em>for you will answer me.</em></p><p><em>8 Among the gods there is none like you, O Lord;</em></p><p><em>no deeds can compare with yours.</em></p> <em>9 All the nations you have made will come and worship</em><em>before you, O Lord; they will bring glory to your name.</em><p><em>10 For you are great and do marvelous deeds;</em>  <em>you alone are God.</em></p><p><em>11 Teach me your way, O <span class="caps">LORD</span>, and I will walk in your truth;</em><br /><em>give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.</em></p><p><em>12 I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my heart;</em></p><p><em>I will glorify your name forever.</em></p><p><em>13 For great is your love toward me;</em> <em>you have delivered me from the depths of the grave.</em> </p><p><em>14 The arrogant are attacking me, O God; a band of ruthless</em><br /><em>men seeks my life--men without regard for you.</em></p> <em>15 But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God,</em> <em>slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.</em> <em>16 Turn to me and have mercy on me;</em> <em>grant your strength to your servant and save the son of your</em> <em>maidservant.</em> <em>17 Give me a sign of your goodness,</em> <em>that my enemies may see it and be put to shame,</em><em>for you, O <span class="caps">LORD</span>, have helped me and comforted me.</em>
