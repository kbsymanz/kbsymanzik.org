<p>The elementary grades at our children's school  performed "Angel Alert"<br />today for Friday Chapel.  They will perform it again tonight for the parents.  I took pictures this morning as, with our camara,  they turn out better in the light.  </p><p>What a blessing the music teachers are here.  They do a great job with the kids!!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/454.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Ben is one tired angel!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/455.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Kirsten sang a solo and played the part of Mary.<br />She had been very nervous but did a great job!!!</p>
