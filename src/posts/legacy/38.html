<p>Just wanted to say Thank you to everyone who visits our website, prays for us, sends Starbucks coffee, letters, packages, etc.....<br />It really means a lot to each of us here.  <br />Philippians 1:2 - 11 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.   I thank my God every time I remember you. In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</p> It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me. God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ--to the glory and praise of God.
