<p>Our camera has died so taking pictures is a rarer event these days.  </p><p>The girls had a "White Christmas" party a few days before Christmas day.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2810.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2812.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />A package from the <span class="caps">USA</span> arrived on Christmas Eve day, providing about 2/3rds of the gifts under the tree for the kids.  What a blessing!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2811.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />We had a Christmas Eve Day Brunch in the morning with some friends.<br />Christmas Day we went to church and had a family meal, complete with turkey and mashed potatoes.<br />We are thankful to God for all His blessings and provisions.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2813.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2814.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p>Blessings to you as you celebrate the coming New Year.</p>
