<p>Jerard started running a fever last night and is on medicine for a urinary tract infection and a fungal infection.</p><p>He had a cranial ultrasound yesterday which shows that the pockets of fluid between his brain and skull are shrinking but the ventricals are not refilling as they should.  It appears all the <span class="caps">CSF</span> is collecting in the areas between the brain and skull.  These areas are drained by the external drains temporarily in place. </p><p>A CT scan will be done Saturday to get a clearer picture of what is going on in Jerard's skull.</p><p>He will probably have another surgery on Tuesday to put in an internal drainage from the pockets of fluid to his abdomen.  </p><p>The external drainage system can only be in place up to 10 days.  Beyond that the risk of systemic infection from the external drains gets very high.</p><p>Keep him and us in your prayers.  Thanks.</p>
