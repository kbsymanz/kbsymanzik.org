<p>Over the weekend Beth and I noticed that Jerard's appetite was significantly reduced.  On Monday (today) Beth took him to see three doctors -- his pediatric pulmonologist and then his neurosurgeon who recommended that he see a pediatric infectious disease doctor.  After that, all three concurred that a stay in the hospital was needed so today Jerald is back in the hospital.</p><p>I just came home from the hospital; Beth will spend the night there with Jerard and I will stay with the other kids at home.  Jerard has an IV and is on a stronger anti-biotic.  The thought is that there is a persistent infection that needs a strong anti-biotic to treat.</p><p>As always, your prayers are appreciated for our little Jerard.  It seems that in his short little life he has had more hardship than many who are much older.</p>
