<p>Malls are noisy places.  Not only is there the noise of people walking and talking, there is the noise of music blaring from loud speakers in the walkways, the din of merchants talking, special displays playing DVD's, perhaps a band or music group singing...it is hard to talk with the one you are shopping with.  The grocery stores are located within each mall so this noise sensation gets experienced on a once or twice weekly basis.</p><p>The streets are noisy places.  In the Philippines, the car horn is a tool and used frequently by all drivers to alert each other of being next to them, in the intersection, etc.  There are horns honking, dogs barking, people talking, whistles blowing.....  At any time of day you can hear roosters crowing, dogs barking, vehicles, horns, etc.</p>
