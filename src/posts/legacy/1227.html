<p><img src="/images/legacy/3875.jpg" alt="" width="86" height="122" /></p><p>On August 13th, James had his interview for obtaining a Philippine passport.  He has been approved and the actual passport should be ready to pick up the first or second week of October.</p><p>We then need to obtain a US immigration visa for James.  We are not sure how long that will take.  But we've been advised it may take longer than we were thinking.<br />As we'd been hoping to travel December 22 back to the <span class="caps">USA</span> this may be delayed due to lengthy wait times obtaining the needed documents for James to come to the <span class="caps">USA</span> with us as our officially adopted son.  If we don't leave in December, we'd probably wait til the school year finishes in May of 2015 and travel then.</p><p>We've learned to hold loosely to our plans and cling tightly to His.  His ways and timing are always right.  So we rest in His leading.</p><p>Please pray for this process to proceed with no complications.  We'll keep you posted as to whether we are traveling to the states in December of this year or May of next year!</p>
