Other popular variations are four, eight, and ten-pointed stars, while rarer ones sport six, seven, nine, and more than twelve points. The earliest parols were made from simple materials like bamboo, Japanese rice paper (known as "papél de Hapón") or crêpe paper, and were lit by a candle or coconut oil lamp. <br /><img src="/images/legacy/3891.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3682.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>we love getting Christmas boxes!!!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/47.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />  <br /><img src="/images/legacy/51.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p>
