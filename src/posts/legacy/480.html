<p>Since the arrival of James and Jerard,  God has been teaching me that no matter what I am doing, be it changing diapers, holding a crying baby, mopping the floor, picking up toys, playing with toddlers, etc.,...it is all for His glory.  Two verses that have been key in this teaching are "So then, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31).</p><p>"Whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him" (Colossians 3:17).</p><p>I wish I could say I'm always thankful for and patient in these opportunities to worship Him in the mundane of every day living....but that would not be true!!!!</p><p>So I found today's blog from John Piper's ministry, Desiring God, very interesting.</p><p><strong>The Gospel Infuses Daily Activities with Meaning</strong><br />October 28, 2009  |  By: Matt Perman </p><p>Mark Driscoll has a great word in his book The Radical Reformission: Reaching Out Without Selling Out :</p>    Every day, people eat, sleep, work, play, love, and hate, but they do not know why. Not knowing where they come from or to whom they are going, they lack the ability to make their lives meaningful.     Consequently, our culture is filled with "successful" people who are mired in anxiety and confusion because they do not know the point of all their toil. But the gospel reveals Jesus as Lord over all of life, who infuses even mundane tasks such as dishwashing with meaning as acts of worship.<p>This also makes me think of Stephen Curtis Chapman's song "A Moment Made for Worshiping." When you first hear the title of that song, you think he's talking about a mountain top experience or miracle moment where everything is going so right that you can't help but worship.</p><p>But instead, the first line of the song is: 6:30 Monday morning. </p><p><em>In other words, the ordinary moments of the everyday are the</em> <em>moments made for worshiping. Everything we do can and should</em> <em>be done as an act of worship. This infuses even the most mundane</em> <em>activities with meaning.</em> </p><p>And, ironically, it rescues the more amazing moments from futility as well, for it turns out that even those moments derive their meaning not from themselves, but from God.</p><p>"So then, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31).</p><p>"Whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him" (Colossians 3:17).</p>
