<p>We all face trials.<br />Some <span class="caps">BIG</span>, some small, <br />God uses all these to shape His character in us....</p><p><em>we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering</em> <em>produces perseverance; 4 perseverance, character; and character,</em> <em>hope. 5 And hope does not put us to shame, because God's love</em><br /><em>has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who</em><br /><em>has been given to us.  Romans 5:3-5</em> </p><p>A friend here facing the trial of the death of a parent sent out this quote from Hudson Taylor this morning in her email.  I share it with you.<br />(pray for Barb, too, as she flies to the states for her dad's funeral).</p><p><em>"...though He does not deprive me of feeling in my trial,</em><br /><em>He enables me to sing,  Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy</em><br /><em>in the God of my salvation.  Thus I do rejoice by His grace and will</em> <em>rejoice and praise Him while He lends me breath.  Now I am happy</em><br /><em>in my Saviour's love.  I can thank Him for all, even the most painful</em> <em>experiences of the past, and trust Him without fear for all that is</em><br /><em>to come." - Hudson Taylor</em></p>
