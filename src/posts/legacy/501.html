<p>Ben and James had the fun of playing with some of the neighbor kids the other day in the vacant lot next to us.  The kids were teaching Ben how to shoot arrows from the coconut fronds.  They had a great time and Ben is looking forward to Christmas break to play more with them.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1600.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1601.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1602.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
