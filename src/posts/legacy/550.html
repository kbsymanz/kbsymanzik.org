<p>James and Jerard were visited yesterday by the social worker in charge of their foster care and adoption case.<br />She explained to us that because the father's name is not on the birth certificate of James and Jerard, they will need to be declared legally abandoned which will open the door for us to file the adoption paper work.  <br />The social worker also has to obtain a copy of the mother's death certificate for us to have in the adoption process.<br />The process for the declaration of abandonment will probably take 3 - 6 months or so.<br />In the meantime we will continue to be their foster family!</p><p>Pray for all of us and for this legal process.  Thanks.</p>
