<p>The live chicken area at the market is an interesting spot.</p><p>Here you can pick out your chicken,</p> take it home to kill it yourself or keep as a pet, <p>or have them kill and clean it for you.....fresh meat!!!!</p><p>But hey, since Mikayla knows how to kill chicken we could take it home live and have her kill it!!!! (search our blog for article and pictures of Mikayla killing a chicken!)</p>
