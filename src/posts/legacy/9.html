<p>This is a marang fruit and we just tried it for the first time tonight.  It is about 6 inches in size (see 6 inch ruler in photo), roughly round, and has a pliant outer skin.  Once through the outer skin, the edible insides consists of slippery, whitish balls about the size of large grapes.  The taste is sweet, but not overly so and there are seeds inside each of the "grape-like" balls that are about the size of a peanut.  Once broken into, the fruit has to be eaten within a few hours or else it will go bad.  At the market, each of these costs about 25 pesos which is the equivalent of 50 cents US.</p>
