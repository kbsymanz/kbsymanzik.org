<p>There is a wonderful, inexplicable participation in the life and power of Jesus when we suffer.  We can have joy and comfort as we travel in this fellowship of suffering.  Christ endured his suffering "for the joy set before Him" (Heb 12:2) so that we can have joy and comfort IN our sufferings.  We have a host of believers who are already in heaven cheering us on.</p><p>Yes, in the midst of pain it may feel like we are alone but at the darkest times Christ works His greatest work in our lives and we must remember we are in a fellowship - a fellowship of sufferers.</p><p>Job, at the beginning of his trials, understood the wisdom of quiet submission to the secret will of God.  "The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord..." Job 1:21......................</p>  The path  can lead through valleys deep and dark, full of pain, tumult, confusion, chaos and also the path can be restful.  <p>There are seasons it seems for the dark and the rest....just as in nature there are seasons. </p> God has a rythym and order to all He designs.  But no matter where the path is leading the main thing is to keep my eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of my faith.  To Him be the glory forever and ever.  Amen and Amen.<p><em>"Jesus has no tenderness toward anything that is</em><br /><em>ultimately going to ruin a man in service</em><br /><em>to Him.  If God brings to your mind a verse which</em><br /><em>hurts you, you may be sure that there is</em><br /><em>something He wants to hurt."</em></p><p><em>Andrew Murray, "With Christ In The School of Prayer."</em><br /><em>Old Tappan, NJ; Fleming Revell Co; 1953</em></p><p><em>above excerpt copyright 2012 Beth M.
