<p>Jerard's head is a full two inches smaller than it had been a week ago.  Last Wednesday, prior to surgery, his head circumference was 19 inches.  Today, at his one week post-op check up, it measured 17 inches!</p><p>Next Wednesday his bandages and sutures will be removed!</p><p>He picked up a urinary tract infection while in the hospital which is being treated.  Please pray he heals well from that.  </p>
