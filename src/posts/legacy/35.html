<p><txp:article_image /><br />We have had the opportunity to live in the community while house sitting for some friends and colleagues.  It has been nice to have a bit more room and feel more part of the culture.  What great motivation to keep up our language studies!!!!! <br />We stayed there about 10 days and will be staying there for another two weeks.  It is on the other side of the wall from the girl's school so needless to say we are very close to school and work!!!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/81.jpg" title=""Sheena"" alt=""Sheena"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Sheena</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/83.jpg" title=""House view from the street"" alt=""House view from the street"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>House view from the street</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/84.jpg" title=""Security"" alt=""Security"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Security</em></p>
