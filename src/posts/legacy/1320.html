<p>Three days a week I spend my afternoons at the middle school/elementary library at the school our kids attend.<br />I teach the K - 5th graders about the library, how to research, etc., and read stories to them.  This semester we are reading stories from around the world, learning geography and how to research with encyclopedias.  James snapped a few pictures of me today while I was teaching the 5th graders.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4244.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4246.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4245.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
