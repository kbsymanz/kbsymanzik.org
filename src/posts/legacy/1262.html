<p>While there are many things to enjoy here in the Philippines, </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4047.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="225" /></p><p>efficiency and bureaucracy are not necessarily on that list!  </p><p>I find it interesting the events God ordains in our lives.</p><p>We were told Tuesday that Kirsten's, Ben's, Kurt's, and my visas could no longer be renewed and we'd have to leave the country and come back in to have them re-issued.  </p><p>So, that is what we are doing!!!  Tomorrow (2/26) we are taking an early morning flight to Singapore.  (though it goes to Manila first.  We will arrive in Singapore around 1:30 in the afternoon.).</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4048.jpg" alt="" /></p><p>While it tends to be a pricey place to spend time in, it was the least expensive place to fly to.    <br />Thankfully we found a good hotel rate.  <br />We will do some sight seeing, enjoy some of the local cuisine, and then fly back to the Philippines on Friday.</p><p>Kirsten and Ben have to miss two days of school.  Not that they are disappointed about that!!!!</p><p>Mikayla's visa is fine and she'll be staying here to care for James.</p>
