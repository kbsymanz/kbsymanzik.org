<p>Welcome to the Symanzik family update.  Having lived in Michigan in the United States all of our lives, living in the southern Philippines is quite different and exciting.  Follow along on this website as we let you know what is different, unique, pleasant, hard, and enjoyable.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to sensitivity issues, we will not be posting details about our work.  This is a cultural/family oriented blog.</p>
