<p>The school year here in the Philippines is starting up soon - most schools will start between June 6 - 13.  Schooling is not free here.<br />We have four students we sponsor from our monthly income - 1 pastor pursuing a seminary degree, 2 college students and 1 high school student.  <br /><img src="/images/legacy/1951.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Emily is in college; Emilyn is starting her fourth year of high school.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/739.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James is a pastor with a vibrant ministry in Dumoy.  He is pursuing</em><br /><em>a seminary degree in theology and in counseling.</em><br />Our other student is starting college.  We don't have a picture of her (yet)!</p><p>This past week we had two other families come to us asking for help in sending their children to school (one elementary and one college).  It was heart-breaking to tell them at this time we were unable to help them.  The needs here are great.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/1101.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/952.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
