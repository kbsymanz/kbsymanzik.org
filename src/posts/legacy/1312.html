<p>We are in the 'ber' months and we experience some moments of cooler temps and also moments of torrential rain.  This is what our street was like yesterday afternoon for an hour or two!  (These photos come from a friend who lives a street or two up from us.)</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4203.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="246" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4204.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p>James and a friend of his were swimming in the street!</p><p>The water came over our yard up to our house about 2 or 3 inches.  Thankfully, not in the house!!!</p>
