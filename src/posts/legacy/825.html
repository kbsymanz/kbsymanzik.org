<p><img src="/images/legacy/2709.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />The care taker of the property we stayed at on Samal island makes charcoal and delivers it to the wharf in Davao - about a 7 - 10 minute boat ride across the bay.  The day we got this picture there were 6 or 7 guys in the boat as well as 8 - 10 large bags of charcoal!  It laid low in the water but they made it safely there and back!!!!</p>
