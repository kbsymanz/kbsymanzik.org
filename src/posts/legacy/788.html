<p>One of our cats had a kitten a few months ago.  She loves to stay in the empty flower pots we have.<br />We named her Ming-Tang - - Ming Ming is what our local friends call kittens; and her colour is orange like Tang!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2553.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p>
