<p>Well, ...I saw a doctor here in Davao for a second opinion.  </p><p>I found her use or words interesting. </p><p>She said, and I quote, "Yes, this report shows cancer but it is benign.  There is nothing to worry about."  <br />She did go on to say that I am at a high risk for cancer but that this report doesn't show I have malignant cancer right now.</p><p>The doctor who did the lumpectomy wants the pathology slides sent to the <span class="caps">USA</span> for further testing.  Thankfully, I have a sister who works at MD Anderson Cancer Center and is helping me arrange to have the pathology lab there look at and evaluate the slides.<br />I will be picking up the slides this afternoon.</p><p>All this to say...well, I might have cancer and I might not!  I'll keep you posted!</p><p><em>Psalm 86</em> <em>7 In the day of my trouble I will call to you,</em>      <em>for you will answer me... 10 For you are great and do</em><br /><em>marvelous deeds;  you alone are God.</em></p> <em>11 Teach me your way, O <span class="caps">LORD</span>,</em>       <em>and I will walk in your truth;</em>       <em>give me an undivided heart,</em>       <em>that I may fear your name.</em> <em>12 I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my heart;</em>       <em>I will glorify your name forever.</em>
