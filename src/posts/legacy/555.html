<p>Yesterday, the Faith Academy Girls team won their first game 2 - 0 , tied their second game 1 - 1, and tied their third game 0 - 0.  They ended up in the top three of 8 teams playing for the day.</p><p>Mikayla, even though wearing lots of sunscreen, burned on her face and behind her knees.  Today she is very uncomfortable with it and her burn will make playing harder for her today.  Pray she doesn't burn more today.</p><p>Thanks.</p>
