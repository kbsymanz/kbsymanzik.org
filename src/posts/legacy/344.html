<p>Hi,</p><p>Just wanted you all to know I am very busy these days.  I go to Resources for the Blind two times a week for occupational therapy.  I am learning how to feel around for things, feed myself, sit up on my own, keep my balance, and exercising to walk.<br />I also have physical therapy three times a week.  "Teacher Liziel" (that's what I call her) comes to our house to work with me.  Sometimes I cry because she makes me work my muscles and I get tired.  But my Mom says I'm sitting up more and more like a big boy.  Teacher Liziel thinks I may walk in the next 6 months, too!  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1023.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>At <span class="caps">RFB</span> with Lola Arlene and Kuya Ben</em> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Practicing walking with Teacher Anna at RFB</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1025.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Learning to take my shoes off with Teachers Daisy and Anna</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1026.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Sitting in a box playing with balls.
