<p>Jerard seems to be doing well.  His blood work was great.  He will have a CT scan next Wednesday to check things out in his head.<br />His antibiotics are done and his heparin lock is out now!!!</p><p>Both boys heads measure 16 inches!  Jerard went from 19 inches before surgery to 16 inches!</p><p>Today I got some cute pictures of James and Jerard next to each other!  Jerard is smiling (as much as he does at this point in his life.)<br />He still has a lot of 'catching up' to do but we are seeing progress and we thank God for that!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/578.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/579.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
