<p>Some of you may know that Ben has struggled with reading.  He'd been erroneously diagnosed with dyslexia by an educational psychologist here but when we had him retested in Manila, it did not prove to be an accurate diagnosis.  He does have some educational challenges but dyslexia is not one of them!</p><p>This year it seems like a light bulb has gone on and he is reading well now!  He recently was one of the top three readers for the month of January in his class!  His teacher rewarded him and the other two top readers by taking them to McDonald's on Friday after school!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2342.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Reader Ben with his Optimus Prime transformer mask on!</em></p><p>Thanks for praying for him and our whole family!  We appreciate the prayers!  Thanks!</p>
