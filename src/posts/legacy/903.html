Manning)</p><p>"Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me."</p><p>I need to have Open Hands<br />Giving Thanks In All Things<br />Hard things befall<br />Giving Thanks<br />In the Eating<br />In the Breaking<br />In the Unknown<br />In the Hard<br />Giving Thanks<br />Breaking Bread<br />He Sustains</p><p>"When Jesus comes into our lives with his scandalous cross in the form of mental anguish, physical suffering, and wounds of the spirit that will not close, we pray for the courage to "stand fast a little" against the insidious realism of the world, the flesh, and the devil." (B. Manning)</p><p>Open hands....letting go of all control....to rest safely in His hands...Ahh the joy of knowing He knows my name, He rejoices over me with joy</p>
