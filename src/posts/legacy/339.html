<p>The title of this article is a partial quote from the movie "Johnny English."  In one scene he says, "It's just a little poo...."</p><p>This was the scene that Kurt found when he went to James and Jerard's room this morning to answer their morning cry...........</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1003.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>yah....it was gross......</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1002.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>James had pulled his diaper off, smeared it on himself, his crib, his sheet.........Needless to say, he got a really good shower with three scrubbings.  The crib, mattress,  and sheet went outside for a good scrubbing with laundry soap.  They are now drying in the sun.</p><p>I guess I would think it a bit more funny if I wasn't so tired from being awakened throughout the night by the neighbor's videoke music that was played extra loud for a party and went til 2a.m.......</p>
