<p>We wanted to take this time on the date of our first anniversary here and USA's Thanksgiving  to voice our appreciation to the many of you who support us with prayers, financial gifts and encouragement. </p><p>We continually give God thanks for our family of supporters who make it possible for us to be here.  While we are careful with the resources that God provides, we are thankful that he is providing for all our needs as they present themselves.  </p><p>We are thankful for the monthly support that comes in for our daily needs and also for the one time gifts that provide for the special needs that come up occasionally.  </p><p>We also could not get by without the continuous prayer and encouragement.  </p><p>We pray that all is well for you as well and love to hear your updates.  <br />3 John 1:2 - "Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well." </p><p>We are enjoying living here, building relationships and loving  the people that God has placed in our lives. Our national colleagues at the office are such blessings to us.</p><p>Fourteen months ago we were not sure we'd be on the field by the end of 2006 which was our goal.  But God worked in marvelous ways  and we were able to fly out November 20 of last year, arriving in Davao on November 22, 2006.</p><p>"Great is the Lord, and most worthy of praise," Psalms 48:1a</p><p>This past year has been filled with many transitions, struggles, and blessings.  The reality of "The Lord is my Shepherd" is a rock upon which we stand.</p><p>"Those who sow in tears, will reap with songs of joy.  <br />He who goes out weeping, carrying seeds to sow, <br />will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with Him." <br />Psalms 126:6-7</p><p>We continue to sow  seeds even when times get difficult.  His promise is there will be a harvest!   We love living here among our friends despite the many challenges of living in a different culture.</p><p>We have faith in our Lord and Savior that His road is the best plan for our lives.  </p><p>Hebrews 11:6 - "And without faith it is impossible to please God, <br />because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."</p><p>Hebrews 12:1Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. 2Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, .... 3Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.</p> 4In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 5And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons:   "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline,      and do not lose heart when he rebukes you, 6because the Lord disciplines those he loves,      and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son."[a] 7Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons.... 11No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it. 12Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. 13"Make level paths for your feet,..... 14Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord."<p>Please continue to pray for our children, especially.</p><p><strong>Happy Thanksgiving to you all!</strong></p><p>With humble hearts and for His Glory,</p><p>Kurt, Beth, Mikayla, Kirsten, and Ben</p>
