<p>For the past month or so I've been really meditating on and daily praying this prayer;    <em>Teach me to treat all that comes my way with peace of soul</em>    <em>and with firm conviction that Your will governs all.</em>    <em>In unforeseen events let me not forget that all are sent by You.</em></p><p>Last week, I had a routine electrocardiogram that came back with the results "abnormal ECG; myocardial infarction".  <br />Needless to say, when I read that I was a bit taken aback! <br />Since then I have had some blood work and a stress/echocardiogram done.  <br />Today I saw a wonderful cardiologist who went over all the results and the bottom line is that I have not had a heart attack!  He recommends a repeat echo in 6 months as there is some fluid around my heart that shouldn't be there (or I could be in the less than 5% of women who have more fluid than what is considered 'normal' and it is 'normal for me!)</p><p>I am having one more test to rule out a possible infection.<br />I am thankful for the good news that I did not have a heart attack!<br />I am thankful to know that I am resting secure in <span class="caps">HIS</span> loving arms; that His will governs all.  </p><p>As Isaiah wrote in chapter 43<br /><em>"Fear not, for I have redeemed you;</em>  <em>I have called you by name, you are mine.</em><br /><em>2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;</em>  <em>and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you;</em><br /><em>when you walk through fire you shall not be burned,</em>  <em>and the flame shall not consume you.</em><br /><em>3For I am the <span class="caps">LORD</span> your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.</em><br /><em>...you are precious in my eyes,...</em></p><p>And a favourite hymn of mine says this:</p><p><em>Jesus, I am resting, resting,</em><br /><em>In the joy of what Thou art;</em><br /><em>I am finding out the greatness</em><br /><em>Of Thy loving heart.</em></p><p>Thanking God for His peace in uncertain times and for His unending mercy and love!</p>
