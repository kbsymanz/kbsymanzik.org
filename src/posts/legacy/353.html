Sometimes I wish I'd die soon so I could go there!......"</p><p>Kirsten's 5th grade class is memorizing Revelation 5:9 - 11.  Verse 9 says  "And they sang a new song:   <em>"You are worthy to take the scroll</em>     <em>and to open its seals,</em>   <em>because you were slain,</em>     <em>and with your blood you purchased men for God</em>      <em>from every tribe and language and people and nation."</em></p><p>As I prayed with Kirsten tonight we thanked God for preparing Heaven and for how awesome it will be to be worshiping at His throne, seeing Him face to face.....too awesome for words....</p><p>Heaven's On My Mind - by Cheri Keaggy<br />"You see a change<br />I'm not the same<br />You may ask me why I smile<br />Don't think that I live in denial<br />Well, lyin' that's just not my style<br />I'm telling the truth</p><p>If you see the light<br />Inside my eyes<br />I can't contain this inner peace<br />It's welling up inside of me<br />If you knew Him then you'd agree<br />And love Him too<br />Just the way I do</p><p><strong>So glad to know</strong><br /><strong>I'm gonna see my God in heaven</strong><br /><strong>So good to be assured of my home</strong><br /><strong>And if you need to know</strong><br /><strong>The reason why I shine</strong><br /><strong>It's because heaven, heaven's on my mind</strong><br /><strong>Heaven's on my mind</strong></p><p>If you see my life<br />And wonder why<br />Now only God gives love like this<br />Surpassing anything you wish<br />To be a chosen one of His<br />A dream come true<br />Let Him reign on you</p><p>They say it's a wonderful world<br />This world we know<br />Still I dream of a better place<br />Our eternal, our eternal, our eternal home" - Cheri Keaggy - </p>
