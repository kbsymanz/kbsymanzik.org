<p>We've had many people ask us what kind of school our kids go to.<br />We are so thankful for Faith Academy, its leadership and teachers.</p><p>"Since its founding in 1982, the goal of Faith's campus on Mindanao has been to provide a quality education for the children of missionaries. Faith Academy Inc. on Mindanao serves over 25 different mission agencies, as well as the business community. Approximately 130 students in grades K-12 represent more than 10 countries. Smaller classes allow for more personal interaction between teachers, students, and families.</p><p>Faith Academy, Mindanao, like its Manila counterpart, seeks to provide students with a quality, well-balanced, Christ-centered academic education....Faith Academy, Mindanao also has enrolled a limited number of international students."</p><p>Check out their website...and for any teachers, retired or active, consider coming over to provide quality Christian education to the MKs!!!!  http://www.faith.edu.ph/mindanao/</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1217.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Part of the school!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1215.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Inner courtyard surrounded by classrooms!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1216.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>After school sports on the soccer field!</em></p>
