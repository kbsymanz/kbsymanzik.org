<p>Now thank we all our God, with heart and hands and voices,<br />Who wondrous things has done, in Whom this world rejoices;<br />Who from our mothers' arms has blessed us on our way<br />With countless gifts of love, and still is ours today.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/942.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>O may this bounteous God through all our life be near us,<br />With ever joyful hearts and bless√®d peace to cheer us;<br />And keep us in His grace, and guide us when perplexed;<br />And free us from all ills, in this world and the next!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/943.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>All praise and thanks to God the Father now be given;<br />The Son and Him Who reigns with Them in highest Heaven;<br />The one eternal God, whom earth and Heaven adore;<br />For thus it was, is now, and shall be evermore.</p>
