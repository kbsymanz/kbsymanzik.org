<p>As Kurt blogged earlier today, please continue to pray for Jerard.</p><p>Around 4a this morning he started having seizures again.  He has had many of them today despite<br />some very strong anti convulsant medications being given to him.  He is not responsive to us to much at all.<br />Around noon he was transferred back to the pediatric <span class="caps">ICU</span> unit.</p><p>He has no fever.  His pneumonia is getting better.<br />This turn for the worse has been  a surprise to all of us as he seemed so much better yesterday. <br />Two of the doctors had signed themselves off his case because they thought he'd be discharged today or tomorrow, but now they are back on the case.  And at the moment it looks like it may be several days  or longer before he is discharged.</p><p>While the first seizure the other day was classified as a 'febrile seizure' (due to a fever), this new round of seizures is indicative of a long-term seizure disorder developing. </p><p>It is not unusual for hydrocephalics or anyone with brain damage to develop a seizure disorder. </p><p>The doctors are amazed he went this long in his life without any seizures.  Now they are trying to determine what combination of medicines will work best for controlling his seizures.</p><p>-Pray for wisdom for the doctors.<br />-Pray for Jerard.<br />-Pray for our family.  This is a stressful time for all of us as we deal with many other issues along with Jerard's hospitalization and health issues.<br />-Pray for the finances we need to cover the cost of his medical care.</p><p>This morning, my Bible reading schedule included reading Psalm 93.  I found it very encouraging to be reminded that He does reign, He ordains all, and in that we rest.</p><p>Thanks for your prayers,</p><p>In Christ, and for His Glory,</p><p>Beth</p><p>Psalm 93</p> 1 The <span class="caps">LORD</span> reigns, he is robed in majesty;       the <span class="caps">LORD</span> is robed in majesty       and is armed with strength.       The world is firmly established;       it cannot be moved. 2 Your throne was established long ago;       you are from all eternity. 3 The seas have lifted up, O <span class="caps">LORD</span>,       the seas have lifted up their voice;       the seas have lifted up their pounding waves. 4 Mightier than the thunder of the great waters,       mightier than the breakers of the sea--       the <span class="caps">LORD</span> on high is mighty. 5 Your statutes stand firm;       holiness adorns your house       for endless days, O <span class="caps">LORD</span>.<p><em>This is the central message of the book of Psalms:</em><br /><em>we encounter divine goodness in the midst of pain."</em></p><p>Cry of the Soul, page 244-5; Dr. Dan B. Allender and Dr. Tremper Longman</p>
