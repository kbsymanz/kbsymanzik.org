<p>The pastor at the church we attend here in Davao preached on that this past Sunday.  <br />God often changed a person's name when He called them - Abram to Abraham, Sarai to Sarah, Jacob to Israel,...</p> ....even in John 15:15 he no longer calls us servants but friends<em>I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know</em><em>his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends</em><p>Imagine....Friends with Jesus.....<br />Let that truth sink in deeply.</p><p>Do you have a good friend? Someone you can talk to and share your heart with? Someone to go out for coffee with, or shopping, or hunting, or whatever interest you and your friend share.</p><p>It is an awesome, amazing, deeply life changing transition to realize Jesus calls me His friend.  I am deeply humbled and thankful to be friends with Jesus.</p> "A friend is someone who stays with you in the bad weather of life, guards you when you are off your guard, restrains your   impetuosity, delights in your wholeness, forgives your  failures, does not forsake you when others let you down..The Friendship of Jesus enables us to see others as he saw the apostles: flawed but good, wounded healers, children  of the Father."<em>Brennan Manning</em>
