<p>Kurt and I went out for dinner the other night, alone, to talk - <br />and with tears in our eyes and voices we both expressed how we feel we have lost Jerard - like he's died to us, but we still have his body and just a small spark of him left to care for.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2950.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><em>Jeremiah 29:11  For I know the plans I have for you,</em><br /><em>declares the Lord,...</em></p><p>His laugh is gone.<br />He had a great laugh.<br />The recognition of voices he used to register in his eyes only occassionally happens now.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2952.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>So, how do I describe Jerard to others when they ask?<br />I don't really know what to say anymore....<br />he startles like a newborn.<br />he doesn't swallow.<br />he seldom makes a sound, except being picked up or bathed.  Both seem to be very uncomfortable experiences for him.</p><p>And we each grieve in our own way.</p><p>Ben talks and tries to tickle him like he used to...and sadness etches on Ben's face as he gets no response.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2951.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Kurt snuggles Jerard with his beard.  It used to make Jerard smile and laugh.  But now?  No response.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2929.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>James puts his face up to Jerard and says, "Jerard, this is Kuya James.  I love you, brother."  And sadness registers in James' eyes.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2955.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>James rubs his brother's head.  There is a slight response of calm registered on Jerard's face.  But oh so subtle.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2954.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2957.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>He is a mix - there is some subtle response at times....<br />but mostly it seems like no one's home.<br />We hold him, bathe him, change his diapers, feed him, <br /><img src="/images/legacy/2956.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />love on him, and hold him up to our <span class="caps">ABBA</span> in prayer - <br />praying that <span class="caps">HIS</span> will be done and we be faithful stewards in caring not only for Jerard, but for each of our children.</p><p><strong><em>Psalm 39</em></strong><br /><em>...2 I was mute and silent; (Jerard is...)</em>    <em>I held my peace to no avail,</em><br /><em>and my distress grew worse....</em><br /><em>...4 "O Lord, make me know my end</em>    <em>and what is the measure of my days;</em>    <em>...."And now, O Lord, for what do I wait?</em>     <em>My (our) hope is in you.</em><br /><em>...9  I am mute; I do not open my mouth,</em>     <em>for it is you who have done it.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2953.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br /><em>...12  "Hear my prayer, O Lord,</em>   <em>and give ear to my cry;</em>    <em>hold not your peace at my (our) tears!</em><br /><em>for I am a sojourner with you,</em>     <em>...13  Look away from me, that I may smile again,</em>     <em>before I depart and am no more!"</em></p>
