<p>James and I studied a few countries and their Christmas traditions this December.  James enjoys cooking so we made the following recipes - hope you like them!  We do!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3992.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="216" /></p><p><strong>Brazilian Coffee Cookies</strong></p><p>1/3 cup margarine or shortening<br />1/2 cup brown sugar (packed)<br />1/2 cup white sugar granulated<br />1 egg<br />1 1/2 tsp. vanilla<br />1 T. milk<br />2 cups flour<br />1/2 tsp. salt<br />1/4 tsp. baking soda<br />1/4 tsp. baking powder<br />2 T. powdered instant coffee<br />Mix all the ingredients together well.

Cut into squares or fancy shapes.  Bake 10 - 12 minutes at 400 degrees F.   While still hot brush cookies with icing.  Store cookies in covered container for one week to mellow OR eat right away (like we did with some of them) - both ways they are excellent!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3993.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="200" /></p>
