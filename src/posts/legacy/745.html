<p>In honor of St. Patrick, we had boiled potatoes, carrots, cabbage, corned beef and "Best Ever Irish Soda Bread" - a recipe I got off allrecipes.com.</p><p>We all agreed it was great bread.  Try making it yourself.  It's very good and easy to make.</p><p>4 cups all-purpose flour,  <br />3/4 cup white sugar,  <br />1 teaspoon salt<br />1 teaspoon baking powder,  <br />1 teaspoon baking soda,  <br />1/2 cup butter, melted,  <br />1 1/2 cups raisins,  <br />1 1/2 cups buttermilk, at room temperature (or if you don't have buttermilk, use 1 1/2 cups milk and 1 Tablespoon vinegar.  That's what I did.  It turned out great!),  <br />3 eggs, at room temperature</p><p>Mix all the ingredients together.<br />Grease a 9 inch pan.  Pour batter into pan and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes - 1 hour.  </p><p>As I ate this bread tonight, I decided it would be good with nuts and a thin glaze of frosting on top for a breakfast bread.</p>
