<p>We have designated Sundays after church as family day.  <br />Each week one of us gets to pick the activity for the afternoon.</p><p>Yesterday was Ben's turn.  He chose to have pizza for lunch and go to <span class="caps">GAP</span> farm.</p><p>None of us had been there except Ben so it was interesting to see what it was.</p> It is sort of a strange place...a collection of farming, statues, walk-ways...There was a swimming pool too. It wasn't a stroller-friendly place to go we learned the hard way!  After walking around the grounds, Kirsten, Ben, James, and I went for a swim to cool off.<p>I did like the statues representing the different tribes of the Philippines.<br />As I looked at them, I was again reminded of the verse in Revelation <em>5:9  "Worthy are you to take the scroll  and to open its seals,</em><br /><em>for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God</em>   <em>from every tribe and language and people and nation,</em><br /><em>10and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God,</em>   <em>and they shall reign on the earth."</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1440.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Under the huge carabau at the entrance to the park.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1441.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Part of a garden area</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1442.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Parade of tribes from the Philippines.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1443.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Parade of tribes from the Philippines.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1446.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Parade of tribes from the Philippines.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1445.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Scene from top of the hill</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1444.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kurt and Ben inside a tunnel the Japanese had dug during WWII</em><br /><em>(the cement statues were added later!!!!)</em></p>
