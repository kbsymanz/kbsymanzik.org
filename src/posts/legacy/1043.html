<p>James' adoption court hearing is coming up on March 4th.  Please pray that it does not get delayed or hindered in any way.<br />Thanks!</p><p>Our God is the God of adoption.  We look forward to James being legally our son.  He already is our son - son of my heart - but the governments don't honor that as far as traveling with him back to the USA!!:)</p><p><em>Ephesians 1:4 - 6</em><br /><em>even as he chose us in him before the foundation</em><br /><em>of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.</em><br /><strong><em>In love he predestined us for adoption as sons</em></strong><br /><em>through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will,</em><br /><em>to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed</em><br /><em>us in the Beloved.</em></p>
