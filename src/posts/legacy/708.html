<p>A few days ago we had a "White Christmas" Party with some friends.<br />It's a tradition we carry on here in the Philippines that our pastor and his wife from our sending church in Michigan do every year.  You invite some friends over.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2273.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2274.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2277.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Wearing of silly hats is a part of the fun.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2272.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2275.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Serve chili, chips and Christmas munchies.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2279.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Play the movie "White Christmas" - the 1954 film with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, and Rosemary Clooney.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2276.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>It is a fun evening.
