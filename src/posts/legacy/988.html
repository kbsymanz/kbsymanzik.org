<p>The church we attend here in Davao has 161 children in their Compassion program.<br />Kurt and I visited the program yesterday morning to get a better understanding about what all the Compassion program does and what our church provides for our kids we sponsor.  We came away awed by all that goes on, the powerful ministry, and thankful for this outreach.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3236.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Praise and worship time for the parents while the children are in Bible</em><br /><em>class and educational instruction.
