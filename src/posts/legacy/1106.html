<p>My oldest sister, Judy, is here visiting for two weeks.  She came over to attend Mikayla's graduation and spend some time with us.  We are really enjoying her being here.<br />Today, the first full day of her stay here, we went to the local market and to Eagle Sanctuary.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3502.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3503.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3504.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3505.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3506.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3507.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p>
