<p>We arrived in Michigan May 24, late evening.<br />Some of our friends from our sending church were there to greet us!  What a welcome surprise!<br />Since then we have been busy visiting with relatives and friends, shopping, enjoying cool weather, spoke at our sending church, etc.</p><p>Kirsten got her ears pierced today.<br />Both girls were treated to new clothes by one of their aunts.<br />Ben is spending an overnight at a friend's house.<br />We've all had our teeth cleaned.  The lack of fluoride in water in the Philippines seems to be causing problems with my family's teeth!!! So we will be shipping back flouride rinse for all of us to use.</p><p>Our coming week has scheduled a family reunion, time with friends, sharing at a supporting church, etc.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1143.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The plane we flew on.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1144.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Layover in Moscow, Russia</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1145.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>My sister, Sarah, met us in Houston during our layover there.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1146.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Cousins together</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1147.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Flying a model rocket</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1148.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Fishing in Grandpa's pond.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1149.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten with her cousin, Hannah, at their hydroponic strawberry</em><br /><em>farm.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla helping Grandpa freeze rhubarb!</em></p>
