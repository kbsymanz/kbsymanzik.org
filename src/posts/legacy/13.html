<p>Saturday we had the opportunity to go to Paradise Island Beach on Samal Island, about a 5 minute boat ride across the Davao Gulf harbor from the Davao City Boat Ferry landing.  What a beautiful place. It has white sandy beaches.  The kids had a great time playing in the sand and sea.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/14.jpg" title=""Ben playing with two new filipino friends"" alt=""Ben playing with two new filipino friends"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben playing with two new filipino friends</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/17.jpg" title=""Kids playing in the water"" alt=""Kids playing in the water"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kids playing in the water</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/16.jpg" title=""Kurt and Beth enjoying baku, a young coconut"" alt=""Kurt and Beth enjoying baku, a young coconut"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kurt and Beth enjoying baku, a young coconut</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/19.jpg" title=""Kids with new friends playing in the sand"" alt=""Kids with new friends playing in the sand"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kids with new friends playing in the sand</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/18.jpg" title=""Our family enjoying our day at the beach"" alt=""Our family enjoying our day at the beach"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Our family enjoying our day at the beach</em></p>
