<p>I spent last week M - F in class from 9a - 4p learning about counseling theories, techniques and tools.  It was an incredible class; a wonderful group of classmates and a great instructor!  Now to start working on the papers - there are 5 papers due by December 10.  I turned one in already and have four more to write!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2115.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
