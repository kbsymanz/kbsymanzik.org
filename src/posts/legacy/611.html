<p>One of the hazards of using public transportation is the chance of forgetting a bag of groceries in the taxi.  I've always tried to keep track of how many bags I put in and take out of the taxi so I don't forget anything.</p><p>But yesterday, for the first time since we moved here, I did not do that.  Probably because I was enjoying good conversation with Mikayla and the taxi driver!  As I put groceries away I was thinking I was missing something.</p><p>Thankfully,  the taxi driver came back to our house about 2 hours after he'd dropped Mikayla and I off and brought our forgotten bag of groceries to us!  We were so blessed by his honesty and willingness to do that!  That is not a common occurrence here.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1894.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
