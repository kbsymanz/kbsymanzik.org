<p>Mikayla and her teammates left today to go to Manila for the International School Athletic Conference soccer (girls) competitions.<br />There will be about 6 or 7 international schools competing.</p><p>Pray for their travel safety and for no injuries.  The team from Faith is going with only one substitute player.  Several of the players who would've gone were recently injured and are unable to play.</p><p>Thanks.</p>
