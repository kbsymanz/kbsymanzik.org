<p>Well, Kirsten turned 13 and she wanted a <span class="caps">BIG</span> teddy bear!<br />She also wanted kwarta (money) as she is saving up for an IPod!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2557.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>The day after she turned 13 she and I (Mom) went on a three day mother/daughter retreat to talk about growing up issues, have fun together, relax, pray, read....it was a good, blessed time!  We discussed purity of the heart, mind, body; growing in Christ, etc. It was a blessed time. We will go shopping for a purity ring soon. </p><p>Some of the books we referenced were The Bible, "A Quiet Heart" by Elisabeth Elliott; "Preparing Your Daughter for Every Woman's Battle" by Shannon Ethridge; "A Young Woman After God's Own Heart" by Elizabeth George; and "A Spirit Controlled Temperament" by Tim LaHaye.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2556.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>In front of the cabin we stayed at in Loleng's Mountain Resort.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2558.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>A scene from Loleng's</em></p><p>I thank God for the time Kirsten and I had alone together.  We enjoyed walking together, talking, playing games, feeding the doves and fish, praying together, reading, etc.</p><p>Keep praying for all our kids to grow in His wisdom and grace.</p>
