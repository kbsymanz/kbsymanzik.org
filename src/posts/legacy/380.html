<p>Faith Academy recently had a concert.  All the groups did very well.  We are blessed with two great music teachers.<br />Ben has been going to music at Faith.  The song they sang was very sweet.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1107.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1108.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1109.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>Kirsten played percussion for the 5th/6th grade band, but it's hard to get a good picture of her when she's at the back of the stage, so here's a pic of her while sitting listening to her sister's band.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1112.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>Mikayla played clarinet in the 7th/8th grade band.  It sounded great.  They did a great medley of "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie music!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1110.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p>
