<p>We moved this past week from a rental on Copper street to a rental on Topaz.  We are thankful to be in this new house which is bigger, has a yard and is very close to the school.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/4143.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>tying our freezer onto the back of the jeepney used for the</em><br /><em>move.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4144.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>It's amazing what all you can fit into a jeepney.   We made</em><br /><em>7 trips with the jeepney loaded to get items from our old</em><br /><em>house to the new one!</em><br /><em>We had lots of help - Danny, the jeepney driver; Erick,</em> <em>Daydong, Kurt, Ben, Ben's friend Jadon, Mikayla, Kirsten,</em><br /><em>Arlene, Daisy, Allie, James, myself.</em><br /><em>So thankful for all the helping hands.</em><br /><em>Moving is tiring and stressful whether its a big move overseas or</em><br /><em>a local move to a different residence.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4145.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4146.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>A big blessing is the piano in this rental.  I haven't had a real</em><br /><em>piano in all the years we've lived here and it's been an enjoyment</em><br /><em>to play again.  I've missed not having a real piano.  I'm so</em><br /><em>thankful for this blessing.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4147.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4148.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>Our dog, Bear, loves not being on a leash all the time anymore.</em><br /><em>At our other rental, since we were in a compound we had to</em><br /><em>keep him on a leash.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4149.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4150.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4151.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p>
