<p>James and Jerard had their first day at the beach yesterday.  <br />It's been my desire to take the babies to the beach for quite a while, but with all Jerard's surgeries and sickness it wasn't possible.  <br />Thankfully, gratefully, Jerard is healthy and doing well now.<br />We enjoyed a wonderful time at the beach!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/709.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The boys ready to go to the beach</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/701.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James in the water with Kirsten.
