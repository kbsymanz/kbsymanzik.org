<p>The Lord is my shepherd....and He leads each of us on the path he wants us to go!</p><p>Kurt and I just celebrated our 17th wedding anniversary on July 7th.  <br />I am so thankful God led my path to Kurt's path and that we have become one. </p><p>We've walked through valleys, up hills, enjoyed sunshine, had rain, dark times, but our journey is always lit by His love and Guidance. <br />I enjoy this adventure we are on. I am so glad that Kurt is my husband! </p><p>I pray Grace and peace to Kurt from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  "I thank my God every time I remember you. <br />4In all my prayers for...you, I always pray with joy <br />5because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, <br />6being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus." <br />Philippians 1: 3 - 6</p><p>It is quite an adventure God has us on in this partnership....I look forward to hopefully many, many more years with Kurt!</p>
