<p><em>Philippians 4: 10 - 12 states "10 I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that</em><br /><em>at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were</em> <em>concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. 11 I am not</em> <em>saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content</em> <em>whatever the circumstances. 12 I know what it is to be in need,</em> <em>and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of</em> <em>being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or</em> <em>hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. "</em></p><p>The peso/dollar exchange rate has been steadily falling - just in the drop of peso to dollar exchange our support has dropped over 12% while the cost of living over here has become comparable to living in the <span class="caps">USA</span>.<br />It's always interesting to see how God provides for our needs!  He truly is awesome in His power.  </p><p>and as my Filipino friends say, "As long as there is rice in the house, there is enough!"</p>
