<p>Today, Kirsten, Ben and I went on a boat trip with about 27 other people to Talicud Island.  There are a couple great snorkel spots the boat stops at plus a beach where we eat lunch.<br />It was a relaxing day on the ocean, enjoying time with friends.<br />Kurt was at work in meetings with his boss from the <span class="caps">USA</span> and Mikayla woke up sick so they both missed a great trip.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1851.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1848.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1849.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1850.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1852.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1853.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1854.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
