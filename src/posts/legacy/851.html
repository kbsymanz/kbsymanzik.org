<p>Cell phones are main communication devices here.  It is important to keep your load so you can send text messages or reply to text messages as needed.  Many little stores around here sell load so it is rather easy to get load when needed - as long as you have the money to buy more load.</p><p>I suspect that if Paul was writing 2 Corinthians 1 today he may have talked about feeling like he was out of load when despairing of life itself.  Saying you feel "out of load" is a way of expressing feeling spiritually and/or emotionally empty or tired from the daily stresses of life.  But, I'm sure that just as God is teaching me in our hard times here, He was teaching Paul that only in identifying with Him in His death and resurrection is true peace found.  In remembering His goodness and grace, and in prayer our spiritual and emotional tiredness can be lifted.  And thankfully, His love and joy and peace and hope are free.<br /><em>"Lord, You have assigned me my portion and my cup,</em><br /><em>and have made my lot secure." Psalm 16:5</em></p><p>_ 2 Cor. 1: 3 - 11(portions of)_<br /><em>3 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</em><br /><em>the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,</em><br /><em>4 who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort</em> <em>those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive</em> <em>from God. 5 For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings</em><br /><em>of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ.</em><br /><em>...8 We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters,</em> <br /><em>about the troubles we experienced in the province of Asia.</em><br /><em>We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure,</em><br /><em>so that we despaired of life itself. 9 Indeed, we felt we had</em> <em>received the sentence of death. But this happened that we</em> <em>might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.</em><br /><em>...and he will deliver us again. On him we have set our hope</em><br /><em>that he will continue to deliver us, 11 as you help us by your</em> <em>prayers.</em></p><p>We appreciate your prayers for us!  Keep praying!!</p>
