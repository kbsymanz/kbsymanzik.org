<p>Psalm 33 says "1 Sing joyfully to the <span class="caps">LORD</span>, you righteous;       it is fitting for the upright to praise him....  4 For the word of the <span class="caps">LORD</span> is right and true;       he is faithful in all he does. 5 The <span class="caps">LORD</span> loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of his unfailing love."</p><p>The Lord has been teaching me more and more about praising Him in easy and hard times.  No matter where we are on earth, He is with us.  The early morning song of the birds, the beautiful colors of the sunset, the lush greenery of plants are all reminders of God's creativity and love.  More and more I find myself falling in love with this place.</p> "13 From heaven the <span class="caps">LORD</span> looks down and sees all mankind;  14 from his dwelling place he watches all who live on earth-  15 he who forms the hearts of all,  who considers everything they do.....21 In him our hearts rejoice, for we trust in his holy name."<p><img src="/images/legacy/29.jpg" title=""Flower"" alt=""Flower"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Flower</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/31.jpg" title=""Scenery"" alt=""Scenery"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Scenery</em></p>
