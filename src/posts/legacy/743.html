<p>an updated word from a Japanese colleague......<br /><em>"Thank you so much for your prayers for Japan and thank you for</em><br /><em>your countries that are sending the rescue teams and lots of</em><br /><em>supplies. There are many places where needs basic supplies like</em> <em>water, fuel, food, medicines and clothes. It's snowing in the</em><br /><em>northern part of the main island tonight but no heater in many</em><br /><em>places.</em></p><p>1 Timothy 2: 1 I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people-- 2 for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. 3  This is good, and pleases God our Savior, </p>
