<p>Every year we celebrate Christmas here brings more and more melding of our western traditions with the fun traditions of our Filipino friends.  <br />It doesn't seem so odd to be sweating and hot at the holiday time as it used to.  <br />We truly enjoy the holiday season here and it feels more 'normal' to us.</p><p>But Mikayla and Kirsten were really missing going to the "White Christmas Party" that our pastor and his wife from our sending church in Michigan host every year.  <br />So we hosted our own today.  <br />We invited all the girls from the 6th and 9th grades to come to our house for tacos, gift exchange and watching "White Christmas."  <br />The girls even wore funny hats which is traditional to do at the party hosted in Michigan!  <br />The weather today was even 'cooler' (80's and lower humidity and a pleasant breeze) and we joked about the possibility of snow here!<br />We had fun!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1619.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Friends at the start of the party</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1620.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Enjoying tacos and talking for lunch</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1621.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Another group shot with the hats on.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1622.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Watching the movie.</em></p>
