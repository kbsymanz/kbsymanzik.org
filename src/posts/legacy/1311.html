<p>November 1 and 2 are big holidays here in the Philippines.  <br /><img src="/images/legacy/4199.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="191" /><br />The cemeteries become like fair grounds with people camping by the grave of a loved one, vendors selling food, plastic light up toys, candles, flowers, balloons....families having reunions at the graveside of loved ones. <br /><img src="/images/legacy/4200.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="183" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4201.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="183" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4202.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="319" /> It's quite a spectacle.  </p><p>We walked around the cemetery where Jerard is buried yesterday.  We placed flowers on his grave but didn't camp out or have a picnic there, though we did enjoy some of the edible delights of the vendors.</p><p>Hopefully I can post some pictures soon. (The pics above are from a local website posted from this holiday weekend here in Davao).</p> Kurt took some photos on his tablet.  I'm waiting for him to load them onto the computer.   I'm really praying for a camera for Christmas!!!
