<p>Ben loves transformers - you know, the toys that 'transform' from robot to aircraft or car.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2646.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>The other day, as he was playing with a new transformer he received, I was thinking how what his toys do is a lot like what Jesus does to us in molding and shaping us into His likeness.</p><p><em>2 Corinthians 3:17-18</em></p><p><em>17Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord</em> <em>is, there is freedom. 18And we all, with unveiled face,</em> <em>beholding the glory of the Lord,are being transformed into</em><br /><em>the same image from one degree of glory to another.</em><br /><em>For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.</em></p><p>Ben's transformer toys have levels of difficulty - some of his are level 1, some level 3, 4, 5 - - accordingly the transformation from robot to car or aircraft gets more difficult.<br />Isn't that like us?  Some transformations in growing in Christ can seem relatively easy, others difficult.<br />I rate the passage in Colossians 3 as a "level 5" - really, how easy is it to be patient, loving, kind, gentle all the time, especially in the light of an ongoing interpersonal issue with either a spouse, child, co-worker, friend?!?!?<img src="?" alt="" />  But thanks to the patience HE shows us, we can extend that grace to our fellow travelers on the road of life.  "Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift"(2 Corinthians 9:15)</p><p><em>12 Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved,</em> <em>compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and</em> <em>patience, 13 bearing with one another and, if one has a</em> <em>complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord</em> <em>has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. 14And above all</em> <em>these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect</em> <em>harmony. 15And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts,...</em> </p><p>`````````````````</p><p><em>Philippians 3:20-21</em></p><p><em>20But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a</em> <em>Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21who will transform our lowly</em> <em>body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables</em> <em>him even to subject all things to himself.</em></p><p>````````````````````<br /><em>Romans 12</em><br /><em>A Living Sacrifice</em> <em>1 I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God,</em><br /><em>to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable</em><br /><em>to God, which is your spiritual worship. 2 Do not be conformed to</em> <em>this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that</em> <em>by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good</em> <em>and acceptable and perfect.</em></p><p>Just a pondering from a fellow traveler on the transforming road of His love and Grace as we journey to our true home - Heaven!!!!</p>
