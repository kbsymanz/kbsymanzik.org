<p>We haven't gone to the market as a family lately so we did that yesterday morning (Saturday).  Specifically, we wanted to pick up some fruit that we have not tried much yet.</p><p>Above is a rambutan (the fruit, not the girl).  This is a very tasty yet weird looking fruit.  Almost everyone in our family enjoys it.  It seems to be in season now and it is being sold everywhere around here.  We purchased a kilo (2.2 pounds) for 25 pesos (about 50 US cents).</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/314.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla and I with a pile of this hairy fruit</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/315.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The inside of the rambutan</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/316.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The seed inside a rambutan</em></p><p>The ripe fruit is opened by just squeezing it until a side splits open.

We purchased a kilo for 30 pesos (about 60 US cents).  This fruit is also opened by squeezing it.  The best way to describe it is as a very sweet and little bit of sour taste all at the same time.  Quite tasty!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/320.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The inside of a mangosteen</em></p>
