<p>My Bible reading schedule has me reading through Job right now.<br />This passage from Job 23 has struck me, again. <br />I can just picture Job standing on his ash heap like a soldier at attention and saying that though his world seems to be falling apart, he knows he is being held in the loving arms of his Saviour.</p> When we were in and out of hospital with Jerard this passage became very special to me.<p>I've been talking with  our kids about hard times in life. </p> God does ordain them, but He is there.  He knows what He has planned.  He understands our moods......<p>And eventually in our Christian growth we get to the place where, though we don't enjoy the heat, we relish the Refiner's fire; knowing it is for our good and growth and for His glory.</p><p><em>God is with me....</em><br /><em>He knows the way I take</em><br /><em>and when He has tried me I shall come out as gold.</em><br /><em>My foot holds fast to His steps</em><br /><em>I am keeping His way - I am not turning aside</em><br /><em>I am not departing from the commandment of His lips.</em><br /><em>I treasure the words of His mouth more than my portion of food</em><br /><em>He is unchangeable</em><br /><em>What He desires, He does</em><br /><em>For He will complete what He has appointed for me and my</em> <em>family.</em><br /><em>and many such things are in His mind.</em><br /><em>Therefore I am terrified in His presence.</em><br /><em>When I consider Him I am in dread.</em><br /><em>God has made my heart faint</em><br /><em>He has terrified me</em><br /><em>Yet I am not silenced because of the darkness</em><br /><em>nor because thick darkness covers my face</em>  (Job 23: 10 - 17 - paraphrased by me)</p>
