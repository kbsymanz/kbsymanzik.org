It's very cute how he says, "Tigger me" if he</em><br /><em>crawls into bed without his buddies!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1902.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten, Ben, and Mikayla riding in the back of the car on the</em><br /><em>way home from a family outing!</em></p><p><em>Psalm 34: 11 Come, O children, listen to me;</em>   <em>I will teach you the fear of the <span class="caps">LORD</span>.</em><br /><em>12What man is there who desires life</em>   <em>and loves many days, that he may see good?</em><br /><em>13 Keep your tongue from evil</em>   <em>and your lips from speaking deceit.</em><br /><em>14 Turn away from evil and do good;</em>   <em>seek peace and pursue it.</em></p>
