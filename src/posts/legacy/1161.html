<p>Eight Redemptive Names of God</p><p><span class="caps">JEHOVAH-JIREH</span></p><p>"The Lord our provider"  - This is also the name Abraham gave to the place where the Lord provided a sacrifice in place of Isaac. (Gen. 22:14).</p><p><span class="caps">JEHOVAH-NISSI</span></p><p>"Our banner, a banner of love and protection"  - Also the name Moses gave to the altar he built after defeating the Amalekites (Ex. 17:15).</p><p><span class="caps">JEHOVAH-SHALOM</span></p><p>"Our perfect peace"  - Also the name Gideon gave to the altar he built at Ophrah (Judges 6:24)</p><p><span class="caps">JEHOVAH-TSID-KENU</span></p><p>"The Lord is our righteousness"  - The name is applied to a future Davidic king who would lead his people to do what is right and thus bring peace (Jeremiah 23:6) and to the restored city of Jerusalem (Jeremiah 33:16). </p><p><span class="caps">JEHOVAH-SHAMMAH</span></p><p>"The One Who is with us everywhere for He is Omnipresent"  - The Jerusalem of Ezekiel's vision (see Ezekiel 48:35 margin) was known by this name. Compare text at Isaiah 60:19-20 and Revelation 21:3.</p><p><span class="caps">JEHOVAH-SABAOTH</span></p><p>"The Lord of Hosts, our Protector." <br />C.H. Spurgeon said this about the phrase "The Lord of Hosts:</p><p>The Lord rules the angels, the stars, the elements, and all the hosts of Heaven; and the Heaven of heavens is under His sway... [the Lord] is on our side -- our august Ally; woe unto those who fight against Him, for they shall flee like smoke before the wind when He gives the word to scatter them."</p><p>See text at Psalm 46:7.</p><p><span class="caps">JEHOVAH-RAAH</span></p><p>"Our Shepherd Who tenderly leads us, loves us and will keep us safe." - the famous Psalm 23 tells us that "The Lord is our Shepherd and we shall not want...." Being illustrated as a shepherd implies a relationship with His sheep (His believers). The term shepherd appears approximately 80 times in the Scriptures, denotating meanings of: feeder, keeper, companion, friend, pastor and herdsman.</p><p><span class="caps">JEHOVAH</span> <span class="caps">RAPHA</span> </p><p>"I am the Lord Your Physician or I am the Lord Your Healer - this name especially was a Name God prophetically spoke about Himself, not one that someone gave Him. Exodus 15:26.</p><p>Holman Bible Dictionary and the book All the Divine Names And Titles In The Bible by Herbert Lockyer used as source for certain material.</p>
