<p>We awoke today to an email announcing the death of a dear friend from our sending church, Walt Horning.<br />Though we do not grieve as those who have no hope (1 Thess. 4:13),  still we grieve.<br />He and his wife Dorothy have been dear and faithful friends of ours, prayer warriors, and supporters for many years.  I sang in the choir with both of them for many years.  They faithfully volunteered with our mission organization for several months each year, going to another state to live while serving at one of the main centers.  They spent a year in Papau New Guniea at a missionary school as teachers.  <br />They greatly encouraged us in answering the call to missions when we felt God leading us to engage in full-time mission work.<br />We pray for God's comfort and peace for Dorothy and the rest of this family in this season of grief and loss.  (Ecc. 3: 1 - 14)</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2262.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Walt as Zechariah in our church's annual "Jesus Walk"</em> <em>celebration."</em></p><p>Walt always had the aroma of heaven beckoning him on. He exuded joy, praise, and exultation over the hope that he had in Jesus Christ.  He had a wonderful sense of humor.  He was compassionate, a hard-worker, a great mentor.</p> He will be sadly missed here on earth.  It will be a great reunion in Heaven to see him again.
