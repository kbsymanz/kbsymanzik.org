<p>The Bible tells us that as Christians we are aliens and strangers in this world and that our real country is  Heaven!  I am so thankful for that.</p><p>While we sojourn through this life, tho, we are now officially registered as Aliens in the Philippines!!!!  We have our "Alien Certificate of Registration" (<span class="caps">ACR</span> for short!)</p><p>But really, like the saints in Hebrews 11, we are longing for a better country....our Heavenly one!!!  I pray you are too!!!!</p><p>Hebrews 11: 13....And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth.....16Instead, they were longing for a better country--a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. </p>
