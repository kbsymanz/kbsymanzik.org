<p>Now that Mikayla is 16 she could date if she wanted to.</p><p>Her Daddy took her out on her 'first date' to a very nice restaurant here the other night!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>I am thankful she has chosen to adopt the "I Kissed Dating Goodbye" philosophy along with some of her classmates and friends.<br />I've been leading a weekly Bible Study with some of the high school girls based on this book.  </p><p>It was written by Josh Harris when he was  21-years old.  It's about his story of giving up the dating game in order to focus on serving God. The hope behind it was that other singles would be helped by some of the lessons he was learning. Most people have an opinion about "that book about not dating." Some love it; others despise it. I'd encourage you not to assume you know what it says without having read it. Many readers who start out critics of I Kissed Dating Goodbye are surprised to learn that the core message of the book isn't about "dating," but living your life for God.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2216.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="309" /></p>
