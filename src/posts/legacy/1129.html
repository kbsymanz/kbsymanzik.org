<p><em>"The strong are not always vigourous,</em><br /><em>the wise not always ready.</em><br /><em>The brave not always courageous,</em><br /><em>and the joyous not always happy.</em><br /><em>Charles H. Spurgeon (1834-1892)</em></p><p>Charles H. Spurgeon fought depression and severe anxiety throughout his lifetime.  Yet he kept on preaching throughout his illnesses and put out a prodigious 3500 sermons and 135 books.  And he said he hated writing!<br />Out of depression can come blessing, even though while in it not much but agony can be perceived.  God sends suffering in order to teach, like it says in Romans 5:3-5 <em>"knowing that suffering</em> <em>produces endurance, 4 and endurance produces character,</em><br /><em>and character produces hope, 5 and hope does not put us to</em> <em>shame"</em></p><p>Waiting on God in the midst of darkness takes extreme effort yet the soul does wait for Him more than watchmen wait for the morning (referencing Psalm 130).<br />God's mercy and grace are new every morning.  His word is my lamp and the light to my feet.  His praise is continually in my mouth and I thank Him for His leading.  </p><p><em>Psalm 103:1-4</em><br /><em>Bless the Lord, O my soul,</em><br /><em>and all that is within me,</em><br /><em>bless his holy name!</em><br /><em>Bless the Lord, O my soul,</em><br /><em>and forget not all his benefits,</em><br /><em>who forgives all your iniquity,</em><br /><em>who heals all your diseases,</em><br /><em>who redeems your life from the pit,</em><br /><em>who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,</em></p>
