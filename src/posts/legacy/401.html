Can't wait to hold them each again in my arms!!!!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1189.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Our family looking at James and Jerard on the computer screen.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James seemed a little bewildered by hearing and seeing us but</em><br /><em>not being able to touch us in real life...he was touching the screen</em><br /><em>to try and touch us....</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1191.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerard wasn't so sure about all the sounds and headphones...</em></p>
