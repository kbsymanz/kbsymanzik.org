<p>The Faith Academy Middle School recently went on a week-long trip to Subic Bay near Manila.  One of the days was spent in jungle survival training.  Mikayla says the water from the water vine was the "yummiest water I've ever had!  It had a whole bunch of nutrients in it from the water vine, and vitamins and was very pure and clear and refreshing.  It gave us new strength because of the nutrients in it."</p><p>More pictures to come soon (like the next day or two or three!)<br />She even ate a bat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
