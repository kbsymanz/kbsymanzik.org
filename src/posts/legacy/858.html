<p>Have you read the book "One Thousand Gifts" by Ann Voskamp?<br />I have to admit I have not read it in its entirety yet...yet already in the first few chapters, I know I need to learn the secret of 'eucharisto' - Thanksgiving......'charis' which means grace; 'chara' is joy....</p><p>Paul learned this secret when he confidently said (and challenged all believers to come to this point too)......<br /><em>10 I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your</em> <em>concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no</em> <em>opportunity to show it. 11 I am not saying this because I am in</em> <strong><em>need, for I have learned to be content whatever the</em></strong> <strong><em>circumstances. 12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know</em></strong> <strong><em>what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being</em></strong> <strong><em>content</em></strong> <br /><strong><em>in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether</em></strong> <strong><em>living in plenty or in want. 13 I can do all this through him who</em></strong> <strong><em>gives me strength.</em></strong></p><p>so in the dailyness of life....changing a 4 year old special need son's diaper, sweeping the floor, folding the seemingly unending pile of laundry, making bread and meals,.....all is to be done in an attitude of Thanksgiving.....</p><p>just as God tells us in Psalm 50....<br /><em>14 "Sacrifice thank offerings to God,</em>   <em>fulfill your vows to the Most High,</em><br /><em>15 and call on me in the day of trouble;</em>   <em>I will deliver you, and you will honor me."</em> </p><p>At times, giving thanks does feel like a sacrifice....other times the thanks roll with such ease.....</p><p>but in all things....to give thanks.....this is the joy in the journey.....</p><p><em>Now thank we all our God, with heart and hands and voices,</em><br /><em>Who wondrous things has done, in Whom this world rejoices;</em><br /><em>Who from our mothers' arms has blessed us on our way</em><br /><em>With countless gifts of love, and still is ours today.</em></p><p><em>O may this bounteous God through all our life be near us,</em><br /><em>With ever joyful hearts and bless√®d peace to cheer us;</em><br /><em>And keep us in His grace, and guide us when perplexed;</em><br /><em>And free us from all ills, in this world and the next!</em></p><p><em>All praise and thanks to God the Father now be given;</em><br /><em>The Son and Him Who reigns with Them in highest Heaven;</em><br /><em>The one eternal God, whom earth and Heaven adore;</em><br /><em>For thus it was, is now, and shall be evermore.</em></p>
