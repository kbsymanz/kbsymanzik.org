<p>Today we are celebrating James and Jerard's first birthday with a come and go birthday party from 2 - 5 this afternoon.</p><p>But today's birthday party for James and Jerard is not just a celebration of their first year of life.  </p><p><strong>In my mind it is also a celebration of all that God has brought</strong> <br /><strong>us through as a family this year.</strong></p><p>It has not been an easy transition for any of us, growing from a family of 5 to 7.  We have each had our own struggles in this process that God has called us in to.</p><p>I am thankful to God for Kurt, Mikayla, Kirsten, and Ben.  <br />Each of us has grown and been stretched in many ways these past 10 months with the addition of James and Jerard to our family.</p><p>But our God, who is rich in mercy and grace has enriched each of us.  We are continuing to grow in His way, not only as individuals, but as a family.</p><p>Kurt asked Mikayla yesterday if given the choice, would she choose to go back to life the way it was in Michigan, or stay on the field as a missionary family.  She said, "stay on the field as a missionary family."</p><p>We are thankful to God for His calling us into missions. </p> We are thankful to God for the ways He is growing us.  <p>We are thankful to God for bringing James and Jerard into our lives.  They are sweet little boys.</p><p>We will post pictures after today's festivities are done!</p><p>Thanks for all your prayers!</p>
