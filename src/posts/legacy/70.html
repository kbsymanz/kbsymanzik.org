<p>Today her foot is not so red nor as swollen.  She'd had a slight fever again yesterday but no fever this a.m.  We sent her to school today.  She'll be on the antibiotic a total of 10 days.<br />Here in the tropics, a 'little cut' needs to be cleaned out immediately as it can fester very quickly into a major infection....which unfortunatley is what Mikayla found out the hard way!!!!!<br />Thanks for praying for her.  She is on the mend and doing better!</p>
