<p>There are many styles of church around here (non-aircon, aircon, nice buildings, not so nice buildings...)<br />But wherever Christians are gathered together is a joy.  Yes, the worship style may be different, they may not sing hymns, but the joy of our Asian believers is contagious.</p><p>Here are pictures from last Sunday's worship at a church we are currently attending.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1381.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1382.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em><span class="caps">DBC</span> has a strong community development outreach.</em><br /><em>This building is being built to house a training center for San</em><br /><em>Rafael area, a poor community near the church.  The plan is to</em><br /><em>train the men and women of that community with job skills</em><br /><em>such as construction, computer programming, etc., so they</em><br /><em>can better provide for their families.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1383.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1385.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>A special guest speaker, Andy, who attends the church</em><br /><em>presented last week's message.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1384.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Kurt and Kirsten listening to the message</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1386.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>A potluck dinner was held after the service in one of the</em><br /><em>unfinished rooms of the new building being built.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1387.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1388.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The 'MC' and Pastor Alan.</em> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1389.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Alma is in charge of the Compassion outreach the church</em><br /><em>has.  There are 120 children from San Rafael area being</em><br /><em>sponsored through Compassion International.  It is so neat</em><br /><em>to see the other side of Compassion working.  We really</em><br /><em>appreciate DBC's outreach ministries to the San Rafael area.</em></p><p>Matthew 18:20 "For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them."</p>
