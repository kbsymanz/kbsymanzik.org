<p>James and Jocy are two very special friends we have here in Davao.</p><p>Recently they had a dedication ceremony for Beth Mari at their home.    </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/822.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The senior pastor from their church led the service.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/823.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Beth with Beth!</em></p> <p>These two wonderful people have a ministry with the neighborhood kids and families and are planting a church.  Right now their home is the church.  James is currently going to seminary to get his degree in pastoring and counseling.  </p><p>Pray for them as they continue to minister to their neighbors!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/820.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James, Jocy, and Beth outside their house.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/821.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jocy, Beth Mari, and Beth</em></p>
