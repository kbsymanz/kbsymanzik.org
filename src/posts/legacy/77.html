<p>Yesterday we just got back from a three day vacation in a place called Nasuli, which is about a four hour drive north of where we are living.  Here is just one of the many sights we saw along the way.  We were following this motorcycle and I took this picture from the front seat of the van that we were in.  </p><p>Do you know what a <strong>skylab</strong> is?  It is a motorcycle with a board attached to the seat to make it hold more people and/or goods.  That is how the baskets are staying in place in the above picture.  In the Philippines, motorcycles are a major form of transportation.  It is a little unusual to see a motorcycle with only one person on it.  Usually, especially in the province, motorcycles hold from 2 to 6 people.  Yes, you heard me right.  We passed a motorcycle on Tuesday that held a family of six including very young children.  Seeing motorcycles with three or four people was commonplace and hardly worth noting.  And these are not large motorcycles either - probably 100cc to 250cc (for you non-motorcycle people those are relatively small).</p><p>Yet, the above picture does not hold a candle to the picture that <strong>I did not get!</strong>  A man and his wife were transporting on a motorcycle a whole sala set (living room set) made out of bamboo.  On his motorcycle was a couch, two chairs, and an end table, his wife and himself.  We were amazed.</p>
