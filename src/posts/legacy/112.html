<p>More on how living in the tropics is different than living in Michigan.<br />~~~~~<br />It's hot here and not unusual to be sweaty all day!<br />~~~~~<br />It is not quiet here.  There are dogs barking, roosters crowing, cars honking, loud motors, loud music.  </p><p>The malls are noisy, too.<br />~~~~~<br />For the kusina (kitchen) the heat and humidity translates into this:</p><p>Stove top cooking  or microwaving is preferred to turning on the oven.<br />~~~~~<br />Dried spices like to cake together.<br />~~~~~<br />Store bread in ref or it will mold really fast.<br />~~~~~<br />There are lots and lots of fresh fruits and veggies here.  And they are not expensive!<br />~~~~~~<br />Shopping at the market is a lot of fun but with white skin the prices go up so it's helpful to know enough Cebuano to barter with them!!!!<br />~~~~~~<br />Medical care here is great.  <br />~~~~~~<br />The stores set up Christmas displays and start playing Christmas music as soon as the 'ber' months arrive!<br />~~~~~~<br />The beaches are great.<br />~~~~~~<br />Come visit us and check it out!  Life here is pretty good!!!!!!</p>
