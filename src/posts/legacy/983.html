<p>Ben started the process of testing for his blue belt in karate on Saturday August 11.  He performed a kada, sparred 4  two-minute rounds with one opponent, sparred one two minute round with two opponents, and sparred one two minute round with four opponents.<br />He also broke four boards.  Check out the video at youtube.<br />http://youtu.be/5WPfJIOECOE<br />His Bible memory testing and self defense are this coming weekend.</p><p>1 Corinthians 9:25-27 (<span class="caps">NIV</span>)<br /><em>25 Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training.</em> <em>They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a</em> <em>crown that will last forever. 26 Therefore I do not run like</em> <em>someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating</em><br /><em>the air. 27 No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave</em><br /><em>so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be</em> <em>disqualified for the prize.</em> </p><p>(<span class="caps">ESV</span>)<br /><em>25 Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it</em><br /><em>to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. 26 So I</em><br /><em>do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air.</em><br /><em>27 But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after</em> <em>preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.</em></p>
