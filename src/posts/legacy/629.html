<p>God has really been impressing on my heart how much he loves me - how much he loves each of us.....</p><p><em>Eph. 3: 17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith--that</em> <em>you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18may have strength to</em> <em>comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and</em> <em>height and depth, 19and to know the love of Christ that surpasses</em> <em>knowledge,...</em></p><p>"It is important to recapture the element of delight in creation.<br />Imagine the ectasy, the veritable orgy of joy, wonder, and delight, when<br />God makes a person in His own image!<br />When God made you!<br />The Father gave you as a gift to Himself...." (B. Manning)</p><p>Selah - pause and think about that!</p><p>Do any of us really appreciate the wonderful gift we each are?  How awesome it is to be made in the image of God?  His incomprehensible love for us?</p><p>"O the deep, deep love of Jesus, vast, unmeasured, boundless, free!<br />Rolling as a mighty ocean in its fullness over me!<br />Underneath me, all around me, is the current of Thy love<br />Leading onward, leading homeward to Thy glorious rest above!</p><p>O the deep, deep love of Jesus, spread His praise from shore to shore!<br />How He loveth, ever loveth, changeth never, nevermore!<br />How He watches o'er His loved ones, died to call them all His own;<br />How for them He intercedeth, watcheth o'er them from the throne!</p><p>O the deep, deep love of Jesus, love of every love the best!<br />'Tis an ocean full of blessing, 'tis a haven giving rest!<br />O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 'tis a heaven of heavens to me;<br />And it lifts me up to glory, for it lifts me up to Thee!" </p>
