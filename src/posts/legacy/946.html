<p>Tomorrow I'll be sharing a short eulogy at the funeral service for Jerard.<br />I have two written up and am not sure which one I'll be sharing.<br />But I'll share them both with you here.....</p><p>In the past four plus years of caring for Jerard I have been occasionally asked what I've thought about Jerard being in our family, if I ever had regrets that we took him in....and to those questions I say this</p><p>Jerard has been precious to me.<br />Jesus made him just the way he was just as Jesus made me and my other children.<br />Jerard's special needs have been irons of fire Christ has used to mold me more into His likeness.<br />Jerard's blindness taught me to see the depth of love Christ has for me and for each of His children.<br />Jerard's weakness helped me admit my own weaknesses and to discover more deeply the truth in God's word that when I am weak, He is strong.<br />Jerard's inability to balance taught me the need to lean into my Saviour more.<br />I loved the way Jerard just seemed to melt into me when I'd hold him.<br />It was a perfect reminder to me of my own need to lean into my Saviour, resting ever in His arms no matter what storm is raging around me.</p><p>I thank God for Jerard.</p><p>The road these past four plus years has been hard<br />steep<br />strewn with anger, hurt, tears, depression...<br />strewn with conflict, sullen silences<br />and yet overarching, God's mercy.<br />His grace.<br />Even in the darkness of soul and family life<br />His light shining through<br />His love lighting a pathway of healing - personally,<br />relationally...<br />I've seen each of us growing in character and Christlikeness<br />I've seen such tenderness in my sons to their special needs brother<br />Jerard's vulnerability has taught me the need to rest and trust completely in my Saviour's care and providence no matter what storm is raging around me.</p><p>This gift,<br />Jerard,<br />our special needs son<br />His neediness is the gift<br />His cute smile,<br />His gentle blind eyes<br />People wonder why we ever took a special needs kid in in the first place 'ignorance is bliss" but this I do know....<br />Love is a commitment<br />Love is not a feeling<br />Love is doing what's right regardless of the cost<br />And isn't that the love my Saviour showed for me and each of us who are Christians when He willingly came to earth, lived a man's life, and willingly suffered, walked the road to calvary, and died? I do not regret the road we've traveled with Jerard<br />It's been a road full of mercy<br />a road leading me closer to my FATHER's love</p><p>And all I know is that all is grace<br />And my <span class="caps">FATHER</span> knew what He was doing when He created Jerard,<br />When He brought him to our family.<br />I rest in <span class="caps">HIS</span> loving arms<br />Thanking <span class="caps">HIM</span> for <span class="caps">HIS</span> gift,<br />Thanking Him for Jerard.</p><p>A comforting thought to me is that now, my Jerard, can see<br />and the first face he's ever seen is Jesus' face.<br />And now I can see him dancing in heaven,<br />smiling,<br />laughing,<br />playing,<br />eating,<br />seeing Jesus<br />seeing colours for the first time ever</p><p>Jeremiah 29:11 says "For I know the plans I have for you,declares the Lord,..."<br />Psalm 139 says For you formed my inward parts;<br />    you knitted me together in my mother's womb.<br />14 I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.<br />Wonderful are your works;<br />    my soul knows it very well.<br />15  My frame was not hidden from you,<br />when I was being made in secret,<br />    intricately woven in the depths of the earth.<br />16 Your eyes saw my unformed substance;<br />in your book were written, every one of them,<br />    the days that were formed for me,<br />    when as yet there was none of them.<br />17 How precious to me are your thoughts, O God!<br />    How vast is the sum of them!<br />18  If I would count them, they are more than the sand.<br />    I awake, and I am still with you.<br />The gift of caring for Jerard has taught me the reality that no matter what God is with me, caring compassionately, gently, patiently for me.<br />I've seen the depth of my depravity and selfishness in caring for Jerard - you know, sometimes I just didn't want to.<br />But the prayer at the end of Psalm 139 has become my prayer - "Search me, O God, and know my heart!  Try me and know my thoughts! See if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!"<br />Every circumstance God allows to happen in my life is for my good and His glory.<br />Jerard has been a gift to me.<br />I thank God for Jerard.<br />As much as I miss him, I am thankful he is now running free in the fields of heaven,<br />able to see and use his body.  I look forward to seeing him again someday.<br />Thank you God, for Jerard.</p>
