<p>Thanks for your ongoing prayers in behalf of Jerard and our family.</p><p>Jerard hopefully will be discharged  tomorrow. <br />He is eating , and has had no seizures for over 48 hours.<br />He still doesn't drink well but he enjoys being spoon fed banana/kamote/Isomil 'smoothies' so he is getting his liquid!</p><p>He will need another shunt operation but the doctor wants to wait two - four weeks to give his pneumonia time to totally clear up.</p><p>Please pray for financial provisions for this surgery.</p><p>He is still very weak on his left side but showing some improvement. His medications have been switched to oral except for his antibiotics. He will come home with a heparin lock for the rest of his antibiotics to be given. We've dealt with that before at home and can do it again.</p><p>Thanks for continuing to pray for him (and for us).</p>
