<p>This past weekend I had the opportunity to go on a men's retreat with my missionary co-workers. The theme of the retreat was <strong>courage</strong>.  It was very refreshing in every way.  We had four in-depth devotional sessions on the theme of courage and what that means for a Christian man.  We had excellent fellowship with one another, great food, and a little adventure to boot.</p><p>The retreat was held at a cabin about 1.5 hours by car away at an elevation of about 4000 feet.  That meant that it was cool, which was quite a refreshing change for us since in the city we are at sea level.  In fact, I neglected to pack my jacket mostly because I had trouble imagining that it could/would get cool enough for me to need it!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/457.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Here we are starting out on our Saturday morning hike to a cave.  This was the easy part of the hike.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/458.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />This is the entrance of the main cave that we visited.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/459.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />The cave had an underground river running through it.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/460.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/461.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Sitting down for some great food and good conversation.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/462.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />A devotional session during one of the evenings.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/463.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />A large beetle that I was trying to pick up. He would latch his legs onto the material so well that I couldn't get him into my hand.</p>
