<p>Life here in the Philippines is exciting, hot, enjoyable.  There are many little vendor stores all over the city...sari sari stores (which are like small convenience stores), barber shops, bike repair, fruit stands, pharmacies, little eateries, etc.    No Starbucks yet but we do have a Trader Joe's here!!!!!(ha ha ha) - well, at least "Joe The Trader!" </p>
