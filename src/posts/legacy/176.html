<p>Jerard's appetite is not as strong as the doctors would like to see it and his electrolites are low.  They started him on a different IV and we are working at getting him to drink milk.  There was blood detected in his stool so they are going to perform XRays today to see if there might be something else wrong, though one of the side-effects of his anti-biotics is blood in the stool, so it is probably just that.</p><p>Jerard is not as fussy today which is good and his bowels do not see as distended.  He is still on strong anti-biotics and anti-fungal medications.</p>
