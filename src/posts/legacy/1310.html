<p>James' immigration visa was denied for several reasons, the main one being, in the legal eyes we have not had full legal guardianship of him for two years.  The foster care license we had was insufficient.  His adoption will be two years old in February of 2016.  Our lawyer has advised us to reapply then through the <span class="caps">USCIS</span> branch here in Manila at the US Embassy.  We will do that then.  Please keep this all in prayer!  Thanks!</p>
