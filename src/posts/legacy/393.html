<p>Hi!<br />After a 44 hour long journey we arrived Sunday night at Detroit Metro Airport.  What a wonderfully pleasant surprise it was to have a "Welcome Home" group of friends from our sending church waiting to greet us when we went to collect our luggage!</p><p>Monday we enjoyed time with relatives and were cold in the 68 - 74 degree weather!!!!BRRRRRRRRR!!!<br />My sister-in-law thought it funny when Mikayla and I were 'oohing and aahing' over the automatic doors; wide, big carts; cleanliness of the store; the fact that the check-out conveyor belt actually worked; and the fact that no one was staring at us while we grocery shopped!  It was very fun to shop for groceries in a US store again!!!</p><p>Today Kirsten awoke with croup and a fever of 101.  Pray she heals up from this soon.<br />Mikayla also is running a low-grade temp and is stuffed up.<br />Ben is just tired.<br />So am I.  I plan to go to bed in the next hour or so.  </p><p>Hopefully I can post some pictures soon!  I need to have Kurt do it as we are using his laptop while we travel and I'm not sure how to do it on this Mac he has!</p><p>Thanks for your prayers!  It is so good to be here for a while and reconnect with family and friends!</p>
