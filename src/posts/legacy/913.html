<p>Mikayla is out in Cagayan de Oro with the high school for outdoor education.  They are working with Habitat for Humanity to help build houses for people who lost their houses in flooding.  They have seen the "tent town" where the villagers have been living since the flooding. They are also assisting in helping a church rebuild.<br />Today, I was able to find a few pictures on FaceBook to share with you all about their trip.  This is from their worship time this morning at the church they are assisting.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2941.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="135" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2942.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
