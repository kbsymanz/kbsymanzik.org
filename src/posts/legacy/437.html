<p>James has decided that naps are not what he needs during the day.</p><p>But in the interest of sanity for his Mom and himself, he definitely benefits from a nap/rest time after lunch.</p><p>In trying to establish that routine in his life I spend some time after lunch rocking him gently and patiently in order to help him relax and rest.</p><p>Yesterday he spent about 40 minutes complaining "no, let go", wiggling, kicking, trying to get me to release him from my arms.  </p><p>As I rocked him I wondered what spiritual lesson could be learned from this event.</p><p>How often am I enfolded in the loving arms of my patient, heavenly Father while I kick and scream, "no, let go..I don't want to do what you're asking me to do", only to have him continue to patiently hold me and wait for me to relax and be at peace with his way.?</p><p><strong>When I take the risk of obedience, I find solid rock and peace.</strong></p><p><em>John 14:27Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not</em> <em>give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled</em> <em>and do not be afraid.</em></p><p>Just as James finally fell asleep in my arms for a much needed nap, may I always rest in my Heavenly Father's arms.</p><p><em>Psalm 131: 2 But I have stilled and quieted my soul;</em>       <em>like a weaned child with its mother,</em>       <em>like a weaned child is my soul within me.</em></p>
