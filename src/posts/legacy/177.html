<p>Our foster care social worker, Lorela,  came to see Jerard and I today at the hospital.  She had some background information to give me on these two precious little guys.</p><p>Their mother, upon learning she was pregnant, took 'the day after' pill four different times in the first two months of her pregnancy trying to abort the baby (at that time she didn't know she had twins).<br />She also went to an 'abortion clinic' of sorts where they try to massage the baby out.</p><p>All attempts to abort these two precious lives failed.</p><p>At four months pregnancy the mother had an ultrasound and learned she had twins.  The ultrasound also showed Jerard had hydrocephalus.</p><p>At six months pregnant a repeat ultrasound confirmed the hydrocephalus.</p><p>At this point the mother and father decided when the babies were born they would put them up for adoption.  This decision was based on two things; economics and neither parent wanting the babies, especially one with health problems.</p><p>Words fail me as I think about the awesomeness of God in protecting these two precious boys in their mother's womb from numerous abortion attempts.</p><p>I can only wonder at the awesome plans God has for James and Jerard.  Already their lives have touched many and helped spread God's word to others.</p><p>Jeremiah 29:11 For I know the plans I have for you," declares the <span class="caps">LORD</span>, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.</p><p>Jeremiah 33:3 'Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.' </p><p>All praise be to Jesus Christ alone.</p>
