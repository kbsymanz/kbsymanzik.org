<p>On Saturday we took a needed break from hospitals and doctors and went on a snorkeling boat trip.  We left the twins with yayas (baby watchers) and went out on a boat called the Flying Squid (pictured above).  We had a great time!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/602.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten and Ben swimming off the side of the boat which was anchored over a coral reef.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/603.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla and Kurt snorkeling.

It looked much better under the water, believe me.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/605.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>What is a boat trip without a funny face from your daughter!</em></p>
