<p>As I write, Beth and Jerald are at the hospital (it is 10:30 pm here) and I am home with the other kids including James.  Everything is  ready for surgery tomorrow at 1 pm.</p><p>The hospital is quite nice though here in the Philippines things are done a little differently.  For example, in almost all hospitals (except for the one that we are in) the patient's family is responsible for finding the prescriptions.  There are no drugs to purchase at the hospital so that often means getting around town trying to find a pharmacy with the needed prescription.  One of the reasons why we chose this hospital was so that we didn't have to do that during Jerald's hospital stay.</p><p>Another example: today I took a friend to the Red Cross to be a blood donor for Jerald.  After the blood was drawn in the morning, I came back to the Red Cross after 5 pm and picked up the blood myself and took it back to the hospital for storage until tomorrow.  I'm glad I didn't drop it!</p><p>In the hospital the family is expected to care for the patient.  The nurses will do the technical stuff but it falls on the family to take care of the patient.  In our case, we have hired a private nurse to help Beth through this first night with Jerald.  Generally it is expected that there will be two people with the patient at all times.  We will see how it goes.  This is our first hospital stay here in the Philippines so we are being a little conservative in our choices.</p><p>Thanks for your prayers.</p>
