<p>It's amazing how painful something like a broken big toe on your left foot can be.<br />Last Thursday I hurt my left toe and thought maybe I'd broken it when it happened.  Then on Sunday I accidentally ran that same toe into a chair leg....ouch.....Then yesterday, helping with soccer just aggrevated it all the more.<br />As it has been becoming more painful I finally went to see a doctor today and he confirmed, yep, it's broken.</p><p>Not much to do for it except wear shoes, buddy tape it to the other toe, and take tylenol as needed.  So that's what I'm doing.  It should take 6 - 8 weeks to heal up.<br />Thanks for your prayers!</p>
