<p>Sometimes in life, the hurdles can seem to high<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2838.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>God's word encourages us to keep on pressing on despite obstacles and trials....He is right there with us!</p><p><strong>1 Cor. 9: 23-27</strong><br /><em>24 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only</em> <em>one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2840.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><em>25 Everyone who competes in the games goes into stric</em> <em>training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we</em><br /><em>do it to get a crown that will last forever.</em><br /><strong><em>26 Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly;</em></strong><br /><em>I do not fight like a boxer beating the air.</em> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2836.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><em>27 No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so</em><br /><em>that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be</em> <em>disqualified for the prize.</em> </p><p><strong>Philippians 2: 13  - 17</strong><br /><em>...for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to</em> <em>fulfill his good purpose.</em></p><p><em>14 Do everything without grumbling or arguing, 15 so that you</em> <em>may become blameless and pure, "children of God without fault</em> <em>in a warped and crooked generation."  Then you will shine</em><br /><em>among them like stars in the sky 16 as you hold firmly to</em><br /><em>the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day</em><br /><em>of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.</em> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2841.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><em>17 But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering</em><br /><em>on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am</em><br /><em>glad and rejoice with all of you.</em> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2839.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2837.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2835.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><strong>Hebrews 12: 1 - 3</strong><br /><em>1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud</em><br /><em>of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the</em><br /><em>sin that so easily entangles.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2844.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p> <em>And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,</em> <em>2 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.</em> <p><em>For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its</em> <em>shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3</em> <em>Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so</em> <em>that you will not grow weary and lose heart.</em> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2842.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2843.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2845.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
