<p>Today's court proceedings for James' adoption were overall very positive.  All the testimony that needed to be heard was.  Three of us needed to take the stand and we were all able to do so today.  <br />Kurt, Venus, our adoption social worker, and I each took the stand to give testimony and answer questions.<br />Our last court date, which is just to work out some technicalities, is October 23rd.  Hopefully a final decision will be issued within 30 - 60 days following that.<br />Overall, we feel very positive about today's proceedings. </p>
