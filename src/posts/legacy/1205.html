<p>Meditating on scripture helps us know Him and the power of His resurrection.</p><p>Before He died, Jesus was in agony, so much agony He was sweating drops of blood.</p><p><em>"And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly</em><br /><em>His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down</em> <br /><em>to the ground" Luke 22:44</em></p><p>Isaiah had prophesied He'd die for our sins.</p><p><em>3 He was despised and rejected by men;</em>  <em>a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;</em><br /><em>and as one from whom men hide their faces</em>    <em>he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</em></p><p><em>4 Surely he has borne our griefs</em>    <em>and carried our sorrows;</em><br /><em>yet we esteemed him stricken,</em>    <em>smitten by God, and afflicted.</em><br /><em>5 But he was pierced for our transgressions;</em>    <em>he was crushed for our iniquities;</em><br /><em>upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,</em>    <em>and with his wounds we are healed.</em></p><p><em>10 Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him;</em>  <em>he has put him to grief;</em><br /><em>when his soul makes an offering for guilt,</em>    <em>he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days;</em><br /><em>the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</em><br /><em>11 Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;</em><br /><em>by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,</em>  <em>make many to be accounted righteous,</em>    <em>and he shall bear their iniquities.</em></p><p>His sacrifice, the final sacrifice, paid the price for our sins.  Our Lamb of God, the perfect Passover Lamb came to take away our sins John 1:29</p><p>Hebrews 9:12<br /><em>He entered once for all into the holy places, not by the means</em><br /><em>of the blood of goats and calves, but by the means of His own</em> <em>blood, thus securing an eternal redemption</em></p><p>He rose from the dead as He'd prophesied.  The angels say that in Mark 16.   <em>Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene,</em><br /><em>who has been crucified. He has risen; He is not here!</em></p><p>God freely gave His gift of love for us to receive.  1 Corinthians 15, the "Resurrection Chapter" states</p><p><em>...Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,</em><br /><em>that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day in</em> <em>accordance with the Scriptures... and if Christ has not been</em> <em>raised, your faith is in vain...</em></p><p>May we each come to know Him and the power of His resurrection - Philippians 3:10 </p><p>Have a Blessed, reflective, full of Thanks Giving, Easter!</p><p><em>Now thank we all our God, with heart and hands and voices,</em><br /><em>Who wondrous things has done, in Whom this world rejoices;</em><br /><em>Who from our mothers' arms has blessed us on our way</em><br /><em>With countless gifts of love, and still is ours today.</em></p><p><em>O may this bounteous God through all our life be near us,</em><br /><em>With ever joyful hearts and bless√®d peace to cheer us;</em><br /><em>And keep us in His grace, and guide us when perplexed;</em><br /><em>And free us from all ills, in this world and the next!</em></p><p><em>All praise and thanks to God the Father now be given;</em><br /><em>The Son and Him Who reigns with Them in highest Heaven;</em><br /><em>The one eternal God, whom earth and Heaven adore;</em><br /><em>For thus it was, is now, and shall be evermore.</em></p>
