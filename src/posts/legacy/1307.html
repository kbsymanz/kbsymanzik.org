<p>Sending a child out to play, to run, on the soccer field, seems like a safe thing to do.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4198.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="223" /></p><p>Yet, here, any grass can house a snake, usually a cobra.  And the soccer field at our children's school houses some.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4197.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="223" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4196.jpg" alt="" width="126" height="84" /></p><p>So, in playing and in fun there needs to be a wariness too - a watchful eye for snakes.<br />As I pondered this I thought of the verses God has for us that warn us the same - be watchful - your enemy the devil prowls about like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour - 1 Peter 5:8.</p><p>My son recently watched 2012, a movie about the whole earth flooding, and he's been a bit concerned about a giant earthquake and flood coming.  This morning he asked me, "Mom, what would we do if a giant earthquake shook the whole world?"  I told him that if that were to happen it would be because God ordained for it to be so and we would rest and trust in His providence and protection as we do in all daily life.  (also made a mental note as a mom not to let him watch scary movies like that).</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4173.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /></p><p>And it's providential that we will be studying Psalm 91 as part of his homeschool Bible lessons.</p><p><em>He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the</em> <em>shadow of the Almighty.</em><br /><em>I will say to the Lord, "My refuge and my fortress, my God, in</em> <em>whom I trust."</em><br /><em>For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the</em> <em>deadly pestilence.</em><br /><em>He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will</em> <em>find refuge;</em><br /><em>his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.You will not fear he</em><br /><em>terror of the night,</em><br /><em>nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in</em> <em>darkness,</em><br /><em>nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.</em><br /><em>A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right</em> <em>hand</em><br /><em>but it will not come near you.  You will only look with your eyes</em><br /><em>and see the recompense of the wicked.</em><br /><em>Because you have made the Lord your dwelling place--</em><br /><em>the Most High, who is my refuge--no evil shall be allowed to</em> <em>befall you,</em><br /><em>no plague come near your tent.</em><br /><em>For he will command his angels concerning you</em><br /><em>to guard you in all your ways. On their hands they will bear</em><br /><em>you up,</em><br /><em>lest you strike your foot against a stone.  You will tread on the</em> <em>lion and the adder;</em><br /><em>the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.</em><br /><em>"Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will</em> <em>protect him, because he knows my name.</em><br /><em>When he calls to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in</em> <em>trouble;</em><br /><em>I will rescue him and honor him. With long life I will satisfy him</em><br /><em>and show him my salvation."</em></p>
