<p>February 4th finds the Faith Academy Middle Schoolers heading up to Manila for 9 days of adventure!  </p><p>Kirsten is really looking forward to the trip.</p><p>They will participate in a band festival with Faith Academy Manila Middle Schoolers, explore historic landmarks in Manila, and then go on the yearly Outdoor Education trip with the combined middle schoolers from both Faith Academies.  </p><p>This year's trip is to Corrigador Island.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1718.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="143" /></p><p>Corregidor is a small rocky island in the Philippines about 48 kilometers west of Manila which is stragetically located at the entrance of Manila Bay. </p><p>Also known as "the Rock," it was a key bastion of the Allies during the war. (<span class="caps">WWII</span>) </p><p>Although Bataan fell on April 9, 1942, the Philippine and American forces held out at Corregidor for 27 days against great odds. On May 6, 1942, their rations depleted, the Allied forces were forced to surrender Corregidor....It was only two years and ten months later in March 1945 when the Allied forces under the command of General MacArthur recaptured Corregidor...</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1719.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="305" /></p><p>The big guns of Corregidor are now silent and the ruins of buildings, structures, and tunnels in the island tell a very moving story of a war that has claimed so many lives. A visit to this former battleground is a memorable experience especially for those who cherish and value peace and freedom.</p><p>(Read more about this island at http://corregidorisland.com/)</p><p>I thank God for the wonderful opportunities our kids have through Faith Academy.  </p>
