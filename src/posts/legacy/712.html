<p>The neighbors behind us played and sang karaoke all night til the sun came up.  They had games and food and drinking going on.<br />Catholics attend a 3am mass each morning for 9 mornings in order to be guaranteed receiving their wish....the true meaning of the birth of Christ in the stable seems a bit lost.<br />The Muslim call to prayer sounds at 4:45am.........</p><p><em>Luke 2:12 This will be a sign to you</em><br /><em>you shall find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.</em></p><p>"Is there anyone in our midst who pretends to understand the awesome love in the heart of the Abba of Jesus that inspired, motivated, and brought about Christmas?....<br />God entered into our world not with the crushing impact of unbearable glory, but in the way of weakness, vulnerability, and need.  On a wintry night in an obscure cave, the infant Jesus was a humble, naked, helpless God who allowed us to get close to him."   (Brennan Manning)</p><p>Blessings on your holiday celebrations.  May each of us remember the <span class="caps">TRUE</span> meaning of Christmas - Christ has come - He is here.</p><p>May our zeal to reach the lost with the true gospel be increased.</p>
