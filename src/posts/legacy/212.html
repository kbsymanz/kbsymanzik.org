<p>Jerard was restless and slept uneasily during his first night after surgery due to pain.  They have been giving him pain medication which helps a lot.  He is eating well and he looks good.  He had a fever during the night of 38.5 degrees Celcius (101.3 Fahrenheit).</p><p>He was running a fever before surgery due to the infection and that was the whole reason for the surgery, so our prayer is that the fever will pass as the anti-biotics take effect.</p>
