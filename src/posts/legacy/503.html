<p>In the Philippines, caroling from house to house is a big event.<br />Recently, a friend of ours who is involved with a senior citizen group here, brought his group to our door to carol for us.  It was very nice to hear their songs and visit with them some.  We provided refreshments of pop and cookies before they went on caroling to other homes.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1611.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
