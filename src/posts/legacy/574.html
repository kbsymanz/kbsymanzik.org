<p><em>"The goal to evade anguish is undesirable because</em><br /><em>our dark emotions have a redemptive side (although this fact does</em><br /><em>not make them any less painful).</em><br /><em>Though tainted in our expression of them, they nonetheless</em><br /><em>reflect the character of God.  They have the power to vocalize</em><br /><em>our deepest cry - and when that cry is uttered before God,</em><br /><em>our hearts are exposed and transformed as we glimpse His</em><br /><em>heart for us.</em></p><p><em>Nowhere does the Bible promise that our earthly lives will be</em><br /><em>untouched by suffering.  Just the contrary, in fact: the New</em><br /><em>Testament repeatedly warns that pain and suffering are part and</em><br /><em>parcel of the Christian life.  But that is not bad news, it is the</em><br /><em>gospel ("good news"), for it is through our pain and suffering</em><br /><em>that we experience joy and encounter glory:</em></p><p><em>Romans 8:17Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of</em><br /><em>God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings</em><br /><em>in order that we may also share in his glory.</em></p><p><em>Romans 5: 2-5..through whom we have gained access by faith</em><br /><em>into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the</em><br /><em>hope of the glory of God. Not only so, but we also rejoice in our</em> <em>sufferings, because we know that suffering produces</em><br /><em>perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.</em><br /><em>And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out</em><br /><em>his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.</em></p><p><em>Paradoxically, God reveals Himself in our suffering.  There is no</em><br /><em>resurrection without crucifixion; no glory without suffering.</em><br /><em>Healing, therefore, isn't quite what we thought it would be.</em></p><p><em>Our dark emotions reveal God; they open the road to true joy.</em><br /><em>This is the central message of the book of Psalms:  we encounter</em><br /><em>divine goodness in the midst of pain.</em>"</p><p>Cry of the Soul, page 244-5; Dr. Dan B. Allender and Dr. Tremper Longman <span class="caps">III</span></p>
