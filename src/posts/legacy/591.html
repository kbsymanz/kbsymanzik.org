<p>Today Beth found out that her lumpectomy results indicate some form of cancer.  She is getting more tests in the days to come so that we have a better idea of what we are dealing with and what the best next steps should be.</p><p>Beth is doing well at this time. She has a peace that is from the Lord. But we would appreciate your prayers for her and us at this time. Times like these are challenging as many of you who have experienced similar things know so well.</p>
