<p>We made it to Houston safely.  We experienced a bit of turbulence the last 45 minutes or so of the flight due to a storm.<br />It is good to see my sister, Sarah.  She has a wonderful house and has purchased many food items the kids are enjoying.</p><p>We are so thankful for the time we had in Michigan with our family and friends.  </p><p>This morning, our sending church had a time of blessing for us before we return to Davao.  They closed the service by singing two hymns of blessing for us.  </p><p>I didn't have dry eyes as we sang these two songs.<br />It is so good to have a wonderful church family.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>In Christ there is no East or West,<br />In Him no South or North;<br />But one great fellowship of love<br />Throughout the whole wide earth.</p><p>In Him shall true hearts everywhere<br />Their high communion find;<br />His service is the golden cord,<br />Close binding humankind.</p><p>Join hands, then, members of the faith,<br />Whatever your race may be!<br />Who serves my Father as His child<br />Is surely kin to me.</p><p>In Christ now meet both East and West,<br />In Him meet North and South;<br />All Christly souls are one in Him<br />Throughout the whole wide earth.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Blest be the tie that binds<br />Our hearts in Christian love;<br />The fellowship of kindred minds<br />Is like to that above.</p><p>Before our Father's throne<br />We pour our ardent prayers;<br />Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one<br />Our comforts and our cares.</p><p>We share each other's woes,<br />Our mutual burdens bear;<br />And often for each other flows<br />The sympathizing tear.</p><p>When we asunder part,<br />It gives us inward pain;<br />But we shall still be joined in heart,<br />And hope to meet again.</p><p>This glorious hope revives<br />Our courage by the way;<br />While each in expectation lives,<br />And longs to see the day.</p><p>From sorrow, toil and pain,<br />And sin, we shall be free,<br />And perfect love and friendship reign<br />Through all eternity.</p>
