<p>During this Christmas break we've been working on a 2000 piece puzzle of Van Gogh's Starry night!<br />It's coming, slow but sure!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3373.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3374.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>The puzzle was a gift for Christmas</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3375.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="246" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3376.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>It's coming along and we have friends coming on Friday</em><br /><em>to help us with it more!</em></p><p>While working on the puzzle, Jill Phillips song, "Wrecking Ball" goes through my head....<br /><em>piece together these little mysteries</em><br /><em>It isn't hard to see the writing on the wall</em><br /><em>Triumph and tragedy, only God can be</em><br /><em>Both the builder and the wrecking ball</em></p><p>God uses all the pieces of our lives for His glory and our good!<br />The light and dark, good and bad, all fit together into a beautiful picture.  Truly, only He who sends good and bad into our lives is truly the builder and the wrecking ball.</p><p>Isaiah 53 speaks to this in verses 10-11....<br /><em>Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him;</em>    <em>he has put him to grief;</em><br /><em>...Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see</em><br /><em>and be satisfied;</em></p><p>He uses the good times and adverse times in our lives to teach us His way.<br /><em>Lead on O King Eternal....</em></p>
