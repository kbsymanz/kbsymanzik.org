<p>Jerard, my visitor from heaven, went to be with Jesus May 18, 2012, when he was 4 1/2 years old.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>I am so thankful he came.  I'm so thankful he was in my life.<br />Not a day goes by I don't think of him and thank God for Jerard.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4034.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p>As Twila Paris says in the song she wrote, the song that was my theme song in my head during the years of having Jerard, the song we played at his funeral....<br /><em>I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you came...</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3812.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p>As part of my own healing from his loss and in honoring what his life meant to me, I've written a book about lessons learned from him.  Anybody know a good editor to help me with editing it to a publishable form?</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3760.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p>I miss my little guy and I am so thankful he came.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3076.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3292.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3271.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3159.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3048.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><strong>Complete lyrics and eulogogy I gave at his funeral</strong> </p><p>I tend to think in songs.<br />Early on in the care of Jerard this song by Twila Paris became a background theme song in my head for our Jerard.<br /><em>A visitor from Heaven</em><br /><em>If only for a while</em><br /><em>A gift of love to be returned</em><br /><em>We think of you and smile</em></p><p>Jerard had a great laugh.  A wonderful smile.  His smile and laugh could brighten up my day so well.</p><p><em>A visitor from Heaven</em><br /><em>Accompanied by grace</em><br /><em>Reminding of a better love</em><br /><em>And of a better place</em></p><p>Jerard's life has reminded me of a better love...the deep, deep, love of my Saviour.<br />Jerard could be messy.  I changed diapers on him all his life.  He drooled.  He liked to bite and pinch.<br />He'd throw up, get sick, be messy....and isn't that how each of us are? A mess?  And yet Jesus continues to love each of us just as we are, no matter what mess we are in.</p><p><em>With aching hearts and empty arms</em><br /><em>We send you with a name</em><br /><em>It hurts so much to let you go</em><br /><em>But we're so glad you came</em><br /><em>We're so glad you came</em></p><p>I am so thankful Jerard came.  I have no regrets having taken him in and walking him through his life these past four years.  He is my son, even if the legal paperwork was not completed.  His name is Jerard Gonzales Symanzik.</p><p><em>A visitor from Heaven</em><br /><em>If only for a day</em><br /><em>We thank Him for the time He gave</em><br /><em>And now it's time to say</em><br /><em>We trust you to the Father's love</em><br /><em>And to His tender care</em><br /><em>Held in the everlasting arms</em><br /><em>And we're so glad you're there</em><br /><em>We're so glad you're there</em></p><p>My arms ache to hold him again. To bathe and feed him, to dress him, rock him, love on him....but I know he is so much happier in heaven and I rejoice for him being there and look forward to seeing him again some day.</p><p><em>With breaking hearts and open hands</em><br /><em>We send you with a name</em><br /><em>It hurts so much to let you go</em><br /><em>But we're so glad you came</em><br /><em>We're so glad you came</em></p><p>Jerard has been precious to me.<br />Jesus made him just the way he was just as Jesus made me and my other children the way we are.<br />Jerard's special needs have been irons of fire Christ has used to mold me more into His likeness.<br />Jerard's blindness taught me to see the depth of love Christ has for me and for each of His children.<br />Jerard's weakness helped me discover more deeply the truth in God's word that when I am weak, He is strong.<br />Jerard's inability to balance taught me the need to lean into my Saviour more.<br />I loved the way Jerard just seemed to melt into me when I'd hold him.<br />It was a perfect reminder to me of my own need to lean into my Saviour, resting ever in His arms no matter what storm is raging around me.</p><p>I thank God for Jerard.</p><p>The road these past four plus years has been hard<br />I do not regret the road we've traveled with Jerard<br />It's been a road full of mercy<br />a road leading me closer to my FATHER's love</p><p>And all I know is that all is grace<br />And my <span class="caps">FATHER</span> knew what He was doing when He created Jerard,<br />When He brought him to our family.<br />I rest in <span class="caps">HIS</span> loving arms<br />Thanking <span class="caps">HIM</span> for <span class="caps">HIS</span> gift,<br />Thanking Him for Jerard.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2306.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2717.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2944.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2952.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3009.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
