He doesn't</em><br /><em>mind the braces.  He has to wear them all the time except during</em><br /><em>bath time and meal time.  He gets pretty messy when he eats</em><br /><em>and we don't want the braces to get all messy, too!</em><br /><em>Please pray with us that he will learn to keep his balance so he</em><br /><em>can work on walking!</em></p>
