<p>Well, life here in the Philippines never ceases to be interesting.</p><p>I called the doctor's office yesterday to verify office hours and told the receptionist which doctor I was coming to see.  She told me the hours and said nothing else.  So, Kurt drops me off at the office.  I walk in and tell the receptionist I am here to see the Doctor.  "Oh, Dr. B. is out of town until Thursday, Maam."</p><p>That seems to be the filipino way.  <br />Ask a clerk at the store if they carry a certain item and if they carry it the clerk will say yes but not offer to show it to you.  You need to specifically ask "may I see it."<br />I should've specifically asked "Is Dr. B in today?"</p><p>My gut feels a tad bit better today but still is painful.  I hope to see Dr. B on Friday....but I'll specifically ask if he is in the office before I go!!!!!</p>
