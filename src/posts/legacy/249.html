<p>Some days are made for reminiscing....<br />today, with the cooler, rainy weather we are having is one of those days.  <br />I was looking at photos of when we first arrived here and of more recent and seeing how much the kids have changed.</p><p>What doesn't show up in the photos is the other changes I've seen in them; growth in their spiritual lives, emotional lives, social lives, maturity.......<br />I thank God for the blessing of children and all the ways He leads us!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/478.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/730.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/728.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/729.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Even James and Jerard have changed a lot from when we first received them five months ago.........</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/515.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/714.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
