<p>102  Hear my prayer, O Lord;<br />let my cry come to you!<br />2  Do not hide your face from me    in the day of my distress!<br />Incline your ear to me;     answer me speedily in the day when I call!</p><p>3 For my days pass away like smoke,    and my bones burn like a furnace.<br />4 My heart is struck down like grass and has withered;    I forget to eat my bread.<br />5 Because of my loud groaning    my bones cling to my flesh.<br />6 I am like a desert owl of the wilderness,    like an owl[a] of the waste places;<br />7 I lie awake;    I am like a lonely sparrow on the housetop......</p><p>11 My days are like an evening shadow;    I wither away like grass.</p><p>12 But you, O Lord, are enthroned forever;    you are remembered throughout all generations.<br />13 You will arise and have pity on Zion; ........</p><p>17 he regards the prayer of the destitute    and does not despise their prayer.</p><p>18 Let this be recorded for a generation to come,    so that a people yet to be created may praise the Lord:<br />19 that he looked down from his holy height;    from heaven the Lord looked at the earth,<br />20 to hear the groans of the prisoners,    to set free those who were doomed to die,<br />21 that they may declare in Zion the name of the Lord,    and in Jerusalem his praise,<br />22 when peoples gather together,    and kingdoms, to worship the Lord.</p><p>23 He has broken my strength in midcourse;    he has shortened my days.<br />24 "O my God," I say, "take me not away    in the midst of my days--<br />you whose years endure    throughout all generations!"</p><p>25  Of old you laid the foundation of the earth,    and the heavens are the work of your hands.<br />26  They will perish, but you will remain;    they will all wear out like a garment.<br />You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away,<br />27     but you are the same, and your years have no end.<br />28  The children of your servants shall dwell secure;     their offspring shall be established before you.</p>
