<p>Hi,<br />Jerard is gaining weight and seems to be in a medical 'calm' for the moment.  No more infections.  One more day of IV antibiotics and then his heparin lock comes out.</p><p>He has a <span class="caps">CBC</span> done tomorrow and  will have a repeat CT scan done the week of March 11.  But for now, no surgeries!!!!YEA!!!!</p><p>James is chubbing out and really enjoys being in the walker we recently acquired!  He loves to coo and 'talk'.</p><p>Mikayla is playing football!  (Ok, for all you <span class="caps">USA</span> people, soccer!) on the Middle School/High School girl's football team.  She is enjoying this very much.  She continues to excel in her school work and clarinet playing. </p><p>Kirsten has been excelling in school work.  She also really enjoys holding James and helping with the boys.  She is truly gifted in art and crafts and loves to create many things!</p><p>Ben is reading well.  He really enjoys sports and will be playing basketball in the after school program starting after spring break.  He is doing very well in school and really enjoys math.  He's been in a growth spurt and seems to have gotten an inch or two taller in the past month or so!!!</p><p>Kurt's job continues to be a good challenge for him.  We feel truly blessed to be over here and involved in the work we are in.</p>
