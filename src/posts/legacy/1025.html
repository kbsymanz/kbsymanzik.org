<p><em>A pain to deep for words stirs in my soul</em><br /><em>A Korean friend's three year old hydrocephalic daughter died</em> <em>yesterday. Her daughter blind, unable to walk, talk...</em></p><p><em>We have the bond of mothers with special needs children.</em><br /><em>Even in language difficulties we understand each other's heart as</em> <em>a mother of a visitor from Heaven.</em></p><p><em>Going to the visitation today stirred up the ache and grief;</em><br /><em>their visitation held at the same funeral home we used for Jerard.</em></p><p><em>My momma's heart breaks for the son I buried six months ago</em><br /><em>and for my friend's fresh loss of her daughter.</em></p><p><em>And we each have a son in fifth grade who have the</em><br /><em>common bond of being the sibling of a special needs child.</em><br /><em>Ben and his classmate share a special bond.</em></p><p><em>Both of us thankful our children are with Jesus...</em><br /><em>Our children are friends in Heaven, playing, laughing, seeing,</em> <em>doing all the things they couldn't here on earth but can now in</em> <br /><em>the presence of Jesus for eternity!</em></p><p><em>but both of us aching to hold our child, our visitor from heaven.</em></p>
