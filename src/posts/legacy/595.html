<p>Jerard is very lethargic from the phenobarbital given him but he is improving.  His fever is gone.  He has pneumonia but it was caught early and is clearing up well.<br />Today he was transferred to a regular room.  Hopefully within the next day or two he will be discharged.<br />Thanks for all your prayers for him.  Please continue to pray for him and for our family.</p>
