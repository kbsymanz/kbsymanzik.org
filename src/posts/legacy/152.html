<p>Born around October 28th 2007, James and Jerald were numbers 8 and 9 in an already impoverished family living in a squatter area here in Davao.  Their Mom died 4 days after their birth.  Their father is not really interested in caring for them.  An aunt had been caring for the babies but is unable to maintain that due to Jerald's health issues and her own impoverished situation.  Jerald has hydrocephalus as you can see in the pictures.  Please pray we are able to provide him with the medical care he needs.</p><p>Kurt and I have been open to adopting for a quite a while if God wanted us to.   My prayer had been that if God wanted us to adopt He would bring the child(ren) to us; we wouldn't have to look for a child to adopt.</p><p>That is exactly what happened.  In early November I casually mentioned to a friend of mine who works with the extremely poor here in Davao that Kurt and I were interested in adopting.  She was just then dealing with the situation of having newborns with no Mom.</p><p>Well, just today the father of the twins tentatively agreed to give the boys up because he cannot (really will not) properly care for them.  The situation is touch and go and there is need for prayer.  Even after all the proper paperwork is signed, the father has a 6 month window to demand the boys be returned to him.  </p><p>So, here we are as tentative foster parents for these two precious boys who just came to live with us just a few minutes ago.  After living here for three years we can start the process to adopt them.  In the meantime we will be holding these boys, caring for their needs, praying over them, blessing them, raising them as our own...and God willing, they will be legally ours in a few years or so!</p><p>Rejoice with us at these blessings.  Pray with us for their salvation and health.  Pray for us as a family.  Pray especially for Jerald's hydrocephalic condition.  We were told today that we might just be giving him a quality end of life.  Please join us in prayer that this is not the case.  Pray also for the whole, multi-year, foster-care then adoption process; it is quite involved and nothing is certain at this point.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/512.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>This is Jerald</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/513.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>This is James</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/515.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James and Jerald</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/516.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla and Kirsten holding James and Jerald</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/517.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerald</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/518.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten and James</em></p>
