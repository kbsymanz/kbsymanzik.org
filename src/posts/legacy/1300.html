<p>Since moving in to the new rental house we've been blessed with starfruit from the tree in the front yard.  Recently it's been fruiting heavily and we've been collecting 20 - 40 pieces of fruit daily.  I looked up on line for recipes and now have much star fruit frozen in my freezer waiting to be made into jelly and jam!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/4152.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4155.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>James picking the fruit before it falls.</em></p><p>I've been researching about star fruit and found out some health benefits are: - it's low caloric - only 31 calories in 100 g of fruit. - it's high in dietary fiber.<br />-it contains good guantities of vitamin C. - it's rich in antioxidant  phyto-nutrient polyphenolic flavonoids.  - it's a good source of B-complex vitamins - it carries small amounts of minerals and electrolytes like potassium, phosphorus, and zinc and iron. </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4154.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p>If you have starfruit in your area, try one of these tasty recipes!</p><p><strong>Star Fruit Chips</strong></p><p>2 firm-ripe yellow star fruit (½ pound)<br />2 cups sugar<br />2 cups water</p><p>Slice star fruit crosswise into thin slices (1/16th inch)<br />Bring sugar and water to boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved.<br />Add star fruti, remove from heat and let stand, uncovered for 15 minutes.<br />Pour star fruit into sieve set over a bowl and drain for 15 minutes.<br />Reserve drained syrup for making more star fruit chips.
