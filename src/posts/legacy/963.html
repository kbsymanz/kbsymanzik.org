<p>One of the many things God taught me through Jerard is that only in weakness is there strength.<br />A friend shared a quote on his FB page that expresses that lesson well.</p><p><em>"As Christians grow in grace they do not become more mature</em><br /><em>in such a way as to gain more confidence in their spiritual</em> <br /><em>abilities.</em> <br /><em>On the contrary, the mature Christian, becomes even more</em> <br /><em>conscious of his own frailty, and will turn unto the Lord for all</em> <em>his/her daily graces. It is only when we are weak, that we are</em> <em>strong (2 Co 12:10). In other words, if we are to be effective</em><br /><em>at all, there must first be a consciousness of our weakness</em><br /><em>and innate spiritual bankruptcy, as well as humility to</em> <em>acknowledge the only source of <span class="caps">ALL</span> spiritual blessings</em><br /><em>- the Lord Jesus Christ"</em><br /><em>~ <span class="caps">JWH</span> from Monergism.com</em></p>
