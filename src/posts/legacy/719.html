<p>At the beginning of the new year, many people make a goal to lose weight and get fit.  Well, one of my kids wanted me to blog about a major loss I had in 2010 in folowing with that sort of resolution.</p><p>It has been my goal for many years to get back to the weight I was when I married.  So, turning 50 in 2010, along with a breast cancer scare, gave me the incentive I needed to change my lifestyle.  I have switched to a mostly vegetarian diet and through eating healthier and exercising 3 - 5 times a week I lost over 40 pounds!!!!<br />Now, I continue to exercise and eat healthy, following the Joel Furhman "Eat To Live" program.  I feel much better and healthier.  Check out his book and website! http://www.drfuhrman.com/ ( "<span class="caps">EAT</span> TO LIVE" is the title of the book.  It is an excellent resource on nutrition and recipes)</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2308.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>At the beginning of 2010, close to 170 pounds.
