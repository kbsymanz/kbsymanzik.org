<p>It is interesting having a child who is total care.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3008.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Jerard spends a lot of time now lying on his side or stomach as we are fighting an almost continual pressure sore near his tail bone.</p><p>There is something special about taking care of Jerard that is hard to explain.  <br />While some may view his life as useless, there is a peaceful, thankfulness I feel in tending to his needs.  He lies there, totally vulnerable to whatever may come his way.  </p><p>and I start thinking.....vulnerability...it can be hard to be vulnerable in relationships.  Weaknesses are hard to admit.       Jerard is weakness embodied.</p><p>I know that God is glorified through our weaknesses but often I just want to show the strong side.      Jerard's life brings God glory in his weakness.  And caring for Jerard brings me closer to my <span class="caps">ABBA</span>.</p><p>Just as David prayed, <br />"<em>Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my</em> <em>anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me,</em><br /><em>and lead me in the way everlasting (Psalm 139:23-24)."</em></p><p>I approach God more openly in the most broken times.  He hears my anger, tears, cries for mercy; .... and He hears praise, thankfulness and my cries  to know <span class="caps">HIM</span> more.  There is like a hunger that wells up in my soul desiring to be closer to my Heavenly Dad.</p><p>Like the song writer says, "I want to know You, I want to hear <span class="caps">YOUR</span> voice, I want to know <span class="caps">YOU</span> more...."</p>    <em>For God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything</em><em>(1 John 3:20)</em><p>I don't know what God's plans are for Jerard, but I do know I am thankful for Jerard. There are hard times, and we've been close to breaking, but maybe, just maybe it takes getting us to a breaking point before we finally learn to let go of our plans and lean fully, trustingly in God's arms.      <em>But I have calmed and quieted my soul,</em>    <em>like a weaned child with its mother;</em>    <em>like a weaned child is my soul within me.</em><br /><em>Ps 131:2</em></p><p>and Isaiah offers a beautiful picture of God holding each of His children in <span class="caps">HIS</span> arms....</p>       <em>he will gather the lambs in his arms; he will carry them</em><em>in his bosom, and gently lead those that are with young.</em><em>(40:11)</em><p><img src="/images/legacy/3009.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Just as Jerard trusts in my arms picking him up to bathe or hold or feed, I am asking God to teach me more of <span class="caps">HIM</span> through this blessing of our weak, vulnerable, fragile son, Jerard.</p>    <em>Teach me your way, O <span class="caps">LORD</span>, and I will walk in your truth;</em><em>give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name</em><em>(Psalm 86:11)</em>
