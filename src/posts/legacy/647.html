<p>For quite a while now I've been wanting to start courses toward a Master's degree in Counseling.   The cost of such a pursuit in the <span class="caps">USA</span> was very expensive when I looked into it years ago;  but here it is very reasonable!</p><p>Here in Davao there is an excellent Seminary, Koinonia Theological Seminary, that offers a Masters of Arts in Theology with an various emphasis'.  I will be taking the degree with an emphasis on counseling.</p><p>Today I registered as a student and will be taking one class in October during the semester break.  The module I am taking is "Counseling Theories, Tools and Techniques."  <br />So pray for me the week of October 11 - 15 as I'll be in class 9a - 6p that week!  Thankfully, my three older kids will be in school that week too!  Their fall break is the week before this class starts!</p><p>My hope is to take one class per semester for at least the first couple semesters.  Then, depending on work load and family life, I may try to speed up achieving the degree  and take two classes a semester.<br />We will see!</p><p>For now, I am just so excited to be enrolled in school again and am really looking forward to this class coming up!</p><p><em>James 4:  13Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will</em><br /><em>go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade</em><br /><em>and make a profit"-- 14yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring.</em> <em>What is your life?
