<p><em>"The inner child is capable of a spontaneous breakthrough of</em><br /><em>emotions, but the Pharisee within represses them.</em><br /><em>This is not a question of being an emotional person or a subdued one.</em></p><p><em>The issue is, Do I express or repress my authentic feelings?</em></p><p><em>To open yourself to another person, to stop lying about your</em><br /><em>loneliness, to stop lying about your fears and hurts,</em><br /><em>to be open about your affection,</em><br /><em>and to tell others how much they mean to you - this is the</em><br /><em>triumph of the child over the Pharisee and the dynamic presence</em><br /><em>of the Holy Spirit at work.</em></p><p>Brennan Manning</p>
