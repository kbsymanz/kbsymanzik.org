<p>The hymn, "Jesus Shall Reign" by Isaac Watts was going through my head as Kurt recently shared with the high schoolers at a recent high school chapel that Jesus Christ is ruling and reigning now, as well as forever more, even though here on earth it can seem that he isn't ruling yet.  Truly, His Kingdom is everlasting!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1481.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1482.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>"1.    Jesus shall reign where'er the sun does its successive journeys run; his kingdom spread from shore to shore, till moons shall wax and wane no more.</p><p>2.To Jesus endless prayer be made, and endless praises crown his head; his name like sweet perfume shall rise with every morning sacrifice.</p><p>3.People and realms of every tongue dwell on his love with sweetest song; and infant voices shall proclaim their early blessings on his name.</p><p>4.Blessings abound where'er he reigns; all prisoners leap and loose their chains; the weary find eternal rest, and all who suffer want are blest.</p><p>5.Let every creature rise and bring honors peculiar to our King; angels descend with songs again, and earth repeat the loud amen!" </p>
