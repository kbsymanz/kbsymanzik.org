<p>Wow....</p><p>it hit me a few minutes ago that today, 9 years ago, we landed in Davao.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4206.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /></p><p>It's been an interesting journey.  One which continues to unfold in various ways.  I've learned to let go of my way and go with His way.  He knows the way I take, the way each member of this family takes.  And I rest in Him.</p><p>Thankful.</p><p>Content.</p><p>Humbled to be called on this missionary journey.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4207.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /></p><p>Thank you for your continued support and prayers!</p>
