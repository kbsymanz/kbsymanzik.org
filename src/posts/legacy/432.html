<p>Another school year starts.</p><p>Every year, the school has a main verse or passage as it's 'foundation verse' for the year.<br />This year's passage is 2 Timothy 3: 14 - 17</p><p><em>14But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have</em> <em>become convinced of, because you know those from whom</em> <br /><em>you learned it, 15and how from infancy you have known the holy</em> <em>Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through</em> <em>faith in Christ Jesus. 16All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful</em> <em>for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,</em> <em>17so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every</em> <em>good work.</em></p><p>This is my prayer for our children as well.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1331.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>The front of Faith Academy</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1325.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Ben, ready for 2nd grade</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1326.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Kirsten, ready to start 6th grade!
