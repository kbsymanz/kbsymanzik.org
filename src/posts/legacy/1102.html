<p>People ask sometimes what life is like here - <br />well, today I'll tell you about water pressure!</p><p>The water pressure from the city gets rather low during the day.  Thankfully, our rental house has a 1000 liter water tank and pump.  Part of the reason water pressure is low for us is that we live on a hill.  But our friends living at the bottom of the hill have the same low-pressure water problems also.</p><p>So to compensate for low water pressure we experience 6a - 7p, I set the timer on our washer to wash a load of clothes at 3a while the pressure is really good from the city supply.<br />Then I start another load around 4:30 while the water pressure is still good.<br />Then I do one more load of wash around 5:30a.  By this time I have to use some of the tank water.</p><p>We've learned to be very conservative with water usage and appreciate the water we have!</p><p>We also keep buckets of water filled for those days the water just decides not to run at all and our tank is empty!!!!:)<br /><img src="/images/legacy/75.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p>
