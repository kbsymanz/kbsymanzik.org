<p>I subscribe to a magazine for women missionaries.   Recently they requested pictures from women around the world with a Bible verse that relates to the pic.  I submitted a pic and you can view it at the web address below.</p><p>Ben is walking on a road in Bagabag.</p><p>http://www.womenoftheharvest.com/picture_praise/2008/WOTH_Picture_Praise_07.html</p><p>(I would've posted the pic but don't know how to resize it without the aid of my resize program that is not available until my computer is fixed!!!)</p>
