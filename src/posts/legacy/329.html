<p>My daughter asked me today how to figure out how many hours, minutes, and seconds are in a year.     <br />That got me thinking.       <br />All our days are numbered and directed by God in His providence.     <br />There are, on average, 365 days a year.  <br />Times that by 24 hours and there are 8760 hours in a year.      <br />Times that by 60 minutes and we get   525,600  minutes per year.       Times that by 60 seconds and there are 3,153,600 seconds per year.</p><p>"O Father, may we each use each second of every day that You have ordained for us for Your Glory.  May we each seek first Your Kingdom and Your righteousness all the days of our lives (Matthew 6:33); studying Your Word, meditating on Your word day and night (Psalm 1), and working out our own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is You, O God, who works out Your good will in each of us. (Philippians 2:12,13)<br />Teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom (Psalm 90:12).<br />May we remember always that You are, have been, and always will be our dwelling place (Psalm 90:1).  From everlasting to everlasting, You are!  Our times are in Your hand.  Help each of us be strong and take courage in You for the tasks You've called us to. (Psalm 90: 15, 23, 24)<br />Thank you for Your love for each of us.<br />In Christ, and for Your Glory,  Amen and Amen."</p>
