<p>Our mission agency had a retreat all day today, the first annual for our office. There were many wonderful presentations and speakers throughout the day. I was invited to share a short message to close the evening. Since it was nearly 8 pm by the time I was to speak, I knew it had to be concise and short.</p><p><a href="http://kbsymanzik.org/file_download/3">Together in God's Rock Tumbler</a></p>
