<p>On Friday, the 2nd day of <span class="caps">ISAC</span>, the girls tied their first game 1 -1 with Brent Baguio, lost their second game 2 - 1 against Brent Subic, and lost thrid game to the First place team , European International School 2 - 0.<br />Reports are that most of the play is happening on Faith's opponent's end of the field...so our girls are putting up a great fight and playing well!</p><p>Pray for Mikayla's sunburn to get better.  March, April and May are the Philippine summer months - the sun is more intense and it is hotter.  Even the best of sunscreens doesn't always work well here.</p><p>Today they have one scheduled game and then playoffs.  I'll keep you all posted!</p>
