<p>My sister Sarah is coming to visit us for two weeks. She<br />arrives on Thursday and we are really looking forward to her<br />visit.<br />This picture was from two years ago when we were in the<br />airport in Houston for a couple hours.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2648.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
