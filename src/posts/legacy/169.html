<p>Jerard is sleeping as I write this.  His hemoglobin is low again so he needs another transfusion.  Fortunately, when I went to the Red Cross to get the blood they had AB+ packed in stock -- no donor needed this time.  That is a blessing since AB+ is rare here in the Philippines.</p><p>What they have determined so far is that Jerard has a urinary tract infection and a fungal infection.  His bowels are distended by gas most likely due to the infections.  This gas is very painful for him and  this causes him to cry a lot and not sleep well.  His appetite is still not very strong.</p><p>The plan is to let the medications run their course over the next day or two and see how he does.  We pray that his appetite returns, that his bowel pains subsides, that his hemoglobin recover, and most of all, that all of these infections are healed.</p>
