<p><em>"Define yourself radically as one beloved by God. This is the true</em> <em>self. Every other identity is illusion."</em><br />â€• Brennan Manning, Abba's Child: The Cry of the Heart for Intimate Belonging </p><p>So thankful to know God loves each of us just as we are, how we are, where we are.  We do not need to clean up our act to come to him.  Just come.  Just as you are.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4279.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="596" /></p>
