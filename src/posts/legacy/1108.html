<p>Today marks the one year anniversary of Jerard's death.</p><p>It's been a hard year on many fronts but His grace is in the pain, His healing is in the wounding, I love my Saviour deeper and I just say, "Lead on o King Eternal."</p><p>I'm so thankful to have Jerard as my son.  I'm so thankful he was our special visitor from Heaven for four and one half years.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3159.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
