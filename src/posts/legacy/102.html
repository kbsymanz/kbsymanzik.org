<p>As Kurt mentioned, we really enjoyed the opportunity to worship with other believers in a church started because of scripture coming to the people in their own heart language.</p><p>Makes me more homesick for the day when we will be in Heaven and be part of ..."a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. 10And they cried out in a loud voice:   "Salvation belongs to our God,   who sits on the throne,   and to the Lamb."" (Rev. 7:9, 10)</p><p>Here are just a few more pictures from that day.......</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/293.jpg" title=""It was a thanksgiving celebration for the rice harvest service.
