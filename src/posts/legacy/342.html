<p>Well, it's hard to corner Mikayla to help me post a blog about her OE trip so I'll go ahead and share a few pics with you from her time in Subic....................</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1010.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>The group being silly in the airport</em>   There were actually about 45 middle schoolers from Faith in Davao meeting up with a hundred or so middle schoolers from Faith in Manila and Bagabag.<br />They were divided into squads from each school group.  Mikayla's squad was called "The Krazy Koalas".</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1011.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Group Praise and Worship Time</em> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1012.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Mikayla on the ropes course</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1013.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Mikayla doing the trust fall</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1014.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Playing with a bamboo curly-q</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1015.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Shaving bamboo to use as a fire starter</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1016.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Getting ready to eat a bat</em>  The bats are tiny and live in bamboo.  Their guide showed them how to catch and cook the bats.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1017.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Mikayla and her friend Krysten don't look to sure about this....</em><br />The guide taught them how to cook rice in bamboo.  Mikayla said it was the best rice she'd ever had.  They also made their own spoon and cup out of bamboo.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1018.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>"Ok........here we go.........."</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1019.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>"Ahhhh.............it's tolerable we think....maybe....."</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1020.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>"We survived!!!!  It's ok but won't become a daily fare!!!</em></p><p>Mikayla really enjoyed her OE trip and is a bit sad this is her last one as a Middle schooler.  But the High School goes on OE also!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1021.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Mikayla at home showing us her bamboo cup and spoon.</em></p>
