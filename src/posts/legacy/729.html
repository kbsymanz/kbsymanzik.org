<p>I love handing the camera to Kirsten and seeing what photos we end up with.  She comes up with many unique perspectives on our home and life around here.  I could put in a plethora of photos from her, but I wanted to share just this one.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2333.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>For some reason, this photo reminds me of a quote from Brennan Manning:  <br /><em>"If we maintain the open-mindedness of children, we challenge</em> <em>fixed ideas and established structures, including our own. We</em> <em>listen to people in other denominations and religions. We don't</em> <em>find demons in those with whom we disagree. We don't cozy up to</em> <em>people who mouth our jargon. If we are open, we rarely</em> <br /><em>resort to either-or: either creation or evolution, liberty or law,</em> <em>sacred or secular, Beethoven or Madonna. We focus on both-and,</em> <em>fully aware that God's truth cannot be imprisoned in a small</em> <em>definition. "</em> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2335.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
