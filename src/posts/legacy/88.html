<p>Frequently, the malls here have praise and worship songs playing mall wide.  One mall in particular also has  times of prayer.  An announcement is made on the PA and all clerks and most shoppers stop what they are doing to follow along in the Lord's Prayer.<br />Another mall doesn't open it's doors until prayers have been said over the PA speakers out in the parking lot.<br />The religious freedom here is really refreshing.</p>
