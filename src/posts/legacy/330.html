<p>We had a game night at our house on New Year's Eve.  It was fun having many friends over, playing Monopoly, Mexican train, Pit, Dutch Blitz, Boogle, etc.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/976.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>The guys playing an intense game of "Robo Rally."</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/977.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Ben and some of his friends playing warrior games.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/978.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>An intense game of "Dutch Blitz."</em> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/979.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Jerard enjoying cuddles with Ate Bebe.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/980.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten and Kristie playing "In a Pickle."</em></p><p>At midnight we blew our noise makers (with the rest of the neighborhood) and prayed, thanking God for all He is and does.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>As I looked around at some of our many friends at our house that evening I was counting my blessings and thanking God for all He does.</p><p>I tend to think in hymns, so bear with me as I share my thoughts by the pen of another.....</p><p>"I lift my heart today in praise<br />To Him Who loves me so,<br />Whose mercy crowneth all my days,<br />And makes my cup o'erflow.<br />O have I loved Him as I should<br />For all His blessings free?<br />Praise God Who giveth naught but good,<br />For He is good to me!</p><p>I'll count my blessings--<br />Count them o'er and o'er--<br />I'll tell my Father's goodness--<br />I will love Him more,<br />I'll count my blessings, bountiful and free--<br />Yet I can never count them all--<br />So good is God to me!"  Carrie Breck</p><p>Charles Wesley wrote this great hymn for the new year.<br />It fits my prayer that each moment I live be to His glory and that I do all He wants me to.</p><p>"Come, let us anew our journey pursue,<br />Roll round with the year,<br />And never stand still till the Master appear,<br />His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,<br />And our talents improve,<br />By the patience of hope, and the labor of love,<br />By the patience of hope, and the labor of love.</p><p>Our life is a dream; our time, as a stream,<br />Glides swiftly away,<br />And the fugitive moment refuses to stay,<br />The arrow is flown, the moment is gone;<br />The millennial year<br />Rushes on to our view, and eternity's here,<br />Rushes on to our view, and eternity's here.</p><p>O that each in the day of His coming may say,<br />"I have fought my way through;<br />I have finished the work Thou didst give me to do!"<br />O that each from his Lord may receive the glad word,<br />"Well and faithfully done!<br />Enter into My joy, and sit down on My throne!"<br />"Enter into My joy, and sit down on My throne!"" </p>
