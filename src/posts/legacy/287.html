<p><txp:article_image /><br />Bear, our dog, got out of the gate yesterday unbeknownest to us until a college-age young man came to inform us Bear was at the end of the street. (The gate had been left open by a propane delivery man on his way out.)</p><p>I ran down to the end of the street, knowing full well that Bear's physical size scares many around here.</p><p>Bear came to me when I called him.  He really is a gentle dog, just large. </p><p>Across the  street were college-age young women screaming because of Bear.  And many of our Filipino neighbors were cautiously watching from their gates to make sure Bear was returned to our yard.</p>
