<p>Jerard is slowly recovering from pneumonia.  </p><p>He still has a low-grade fever and sleeps a lot but today he was more playful, which is a great sign.  </p><p>The big concern with him being so sick is that his shunt could get infected.  Thankfully so far there are no signs of that.  </p><p>In God's providential timing, our friend across the street who is a doctor,  'just happens' to have two pediatric intensive care nurses visiting from the states now.  They both checked out Jerard and were in agreement that he is showing no signs of shunt infection!</p><p>God's mercies and grace are so awesome!</p><p>Keep Jerard in your prayers!  Thanks.</p>
