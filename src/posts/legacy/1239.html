<p>Ben has been growing majorly in height, stature, wisdom....I am thankful for the fine qualities I see in my young man.  He is now at least 1/2 inch taller than me and still growing!!!!  Thanking God for the blessing of sons!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3913.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p>
