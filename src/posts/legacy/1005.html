<p>Matthew 6:19-21  Lay Up Treasures in Heaven</p><p><em>19 "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth</em> <em>and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, 20 but</em><br /><em>lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth</em> <em>nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.</em><br /><em>21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</em></p><p>A thief or two reached in through our front sala windows last night while we were sleeping and stole a Mac laptop and a net book computer we had in the sala (living room).   </p> It is very unsettling to know someone broke in while we were sleeping.  They were unable to get in to the house due to security bars and locks, but they removed the window screens and reached in through the bars to get the laptop and net book.<p>Pray for us while we work through all this.  The laptop was Mikayla's computer for school.  We need to get her another laptop soon - hopefully one that is stronger and better and would last her a year or two into college.</p><p>We consider ourselves fortunate that this is the first robbery we've had in 6 years of living here.  Friends of ours have been robbed many times here.</p>
