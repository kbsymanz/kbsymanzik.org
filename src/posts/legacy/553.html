<p>Mindanao is experiencing a drought.  Farm lands are dry and cracking.<br />The soccer field grass at school is brown.  Water levels in the lakes are low.<br />This is causing the power company to  reduce generation capacity of the hydro electric plants in Lake Lanao in Lanao del Sur and Pulangi River in Bukidnon as advised by the National Grid Corporation of the Phils. (<span class="caps">NGCP</span>).  <br />We've been told to expect a two hour power outage daily.  It hasn't been occuring every day as the schedule at the power company's website says, but we are experiencing outages about 2 - 5 times a week.</p><p>So, pray for rain.  It's been a long time since there has been any significant rain fall here.   </p>
