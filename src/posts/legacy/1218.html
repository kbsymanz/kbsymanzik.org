<p>James washes dishes in his own unique way.

It's fun to watch him!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3859.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3860.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3861.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3862.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p>
