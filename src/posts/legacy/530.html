<p>Faith Academy Middle School presented "Keeper of the Tales - Stories from 1001 Arabian Nights" by Tim Wright last night.<br />They are performing again tonight, also.</p><p>Janet Templin did an excellent job directing the play along with Lisa Bartels.<br />The main story is about a blind beggar-sage who is at the Bazaar (market) and tells the Princess stories that are like parables.   It was a very good production.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1707.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The princess and her servant listening to Kamal, the blind beggar</em></p><p>Kirsten played the part of Sayyd - the twin daughter of Yasin, the Devoted Israelite.  She was also one of the fruit market vendors at the Bazaar.</p><p>Kirsten really enjoys the thespian world (although I had to tell her what a 'thespian' was/is)!  She's already talking about going out for next year's school play.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1702.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten the market vendor</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1703.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Sayyd (Kirsten) with her 'twin brother', Saad, with their</em><br /><em>'mother' Khadija</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1704.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Saad and Sayyd - it was fun to watch these two.
