<p>Thursday night, Kurt and I noticed that Jerard's first shunt site seemed red and swollen.  </p><p>Friday morning it looked worse so we took him to Dr. Soriano, the neurosurgeon,  for a check up.  Dr. Soriano drew off some puss- like fluid to test it.</p><p>Over the weekend Jerard starting running a fever and the sore on his shunt site 'popped' and oozed out stuff.</p><p>Today, Jerard had a check up and we obtained the results of the culture and sensitivity taken Friday.  </p><p>He has pseudomonas aeroginosa - an opportunistic pathogen which exploits a break in the host  defences.  It can cause <span class="caps">UTI</span> and other infections.  It's the number 1 hospital-acquired infection.</p><p>So what's that mean for Jerard? </p> Probably more IV antibiotics and a need to replace the shunt.<p>A determination will be made tomorrow about the need to rehospitalize him and a shunt-replacement surgery.</p><p>Pray for Jerard to get well.  Pray for our family for the stamina and endurance we need for another hospital stay if that is determined to be the best course of action.</p>
