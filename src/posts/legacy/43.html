<p>Talking to the receptionist at the pediatrician's office yesterday she said, "It seems in United States people are always racing against time.  Here we do not."</p><p>That is one of many things I am really enjoying about the Philippines; everything moves at a slower pace.  People take more time to talk with each other.  I have enjoyed having coffee with friends on a once or twice weekly basis, the helpfulness of merchants, not feeling rushed.  </p><p>I guess I'm learning to step off the race track and stop racing against time!!!!</p>
