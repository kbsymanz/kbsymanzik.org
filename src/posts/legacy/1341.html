<p><em>"If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey going astray,</em><br /><em>you shall bring it back to him. 5 If you see the donkey of one</em><br /><em>who hates you lying down under its burden, you shall refrain from</em> <em>leaving him with it; you shall rescue it with him." Leviticus 23:4-5</em></p><p>While not our enemies, there are some neighbors who graze their goats in the neighboring vacant lot to our home.  Occassionally one of them wraps itself around a branch or gets tangled in its rope and Kurt will go rescue it.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4322.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p>
