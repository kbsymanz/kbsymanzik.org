<p>I realized today I'd never posted pictures of the shells we found on the beach at Isla Reta.</p><p>When I look at the intricate detail God put into the shells and coral I am amazed and awed at His creativity!</p><p>Psalm 92: 1-5 It is good to give thanks to the <span class="caps">LORD</span>,   to sing praises to your name, O Most High;<br />to declare your steadfast love in the morning,   and your faithfulness by night,.....<br /><em>For you, O <span class="caps">LORD</span>, have made me glad by your work;</em>   <em>at the works of your hands I sing for joy.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/834.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p> <em>How great are your works, O LORD!</em>   <em>Your thoughts are very deep!</em><p>Psalm 86:8 There is none like you among the gods, O Lord,    <em>nor are there any works like yours.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/835.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
