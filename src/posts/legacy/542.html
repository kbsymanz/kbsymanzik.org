<p><em>Proverbs 16:9 The heart of man plans his way,</em>   <em>but the <span class="caps">LORD</span> establishes his steps.</em></p><p>It is wonderful to rest in Him, knowing that He has everything planned out.</p><p>We recently met with the lawyer who will be handling our adoption case.  We have more papers to collect and it looks like it will be another couple months before all the paperwork is gathered and we are able to file our petition for adoption for James and Jerard.</p><p>We had been considering moving to a house that would cost a bit less rent then the one we are renting now.  But our lawyer has strongly advised us not to do that.  It looks bad in the courts eyes for us to be transferring houses during the adoption process.  So we will stay where we are.</p><p>Elizabeth Elliott is my mentor through her writing.  She shares in "Keep A Quiet Heart" "If I am willing to be still in my Master's hand, can I not then be still in everything?  He's got the whole world in His hands!....If I mean to be obedient and submissive to the Lord because He is my Lord, I must not forget that whatever He allows to happen becomes, for me, His will at that moment...." </p>
