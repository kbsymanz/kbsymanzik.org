<p>In this environment, all 'puti' (white skinned people) are viewed as 'dato' (rich).  </p><p>Many times while shopping I have sales clerks take me to the higher priced items in the store only to look at me in disbelief if I walk away and don't buy the expensive item!  Most recently I was looking for a gift for Ben to take to a birthday party.  The sales clerk in the toy department kept pointing out the higher end remote control cars as an option.  (In US dollars they would've been $40 - $80).  I told him, "no, I can't afford that" a couple times.  The look on his face was one of incredulousness - as if I was the biggest lier of all times!</p><p>Another time, while checking out at a grocery store, after the sales clerk rang up my order, the filipino lady standing behind me turned the cash register screen towards her so she could see how much I was spending!</p><p>Once, while traveling to Nasuli, our driver (a filipino) stopped at a rest area.  Merchants were there and I heard the hat sales man offer a hat to our driver for 150 pesos.  Then he came to Kurt and offered him the same hat for 300 pesos!  "Puti Dato" in action!!!!!!!</p>
