<p>My prayer for myself and our family is that each of us will seek first Him and His righteousness (Matthew 6:33).<br />In Elisabeth Elliott's book "Keep A Quiet Heart" this quote struck me this morning as I meditated on what it really means to seek first Him and His righteousness.  I hope this gives you something to ponder also.</p><p><em>"If through losing what this world prizes we are enabled to gain what it</em><br /><em>despises - treasure in heaven, invisible and incorruptible - isn't it worth</em><br /><em>any kind of suffering?  What is it worth to us to learn a little bit more</em><br /><em>of what the Cross means - life out of death, the transformation of</em><br /><em>earth's losses and heartbreaks and tragedies?...God has allowed in the</em><br /><em>lives of each of us some sort of loss, the withdrawal of something we</em><br /><em>valued, in order that we may learn to offer ourselves a little more</em><br /><em>willingly, to allow the touch of death on one more thing we have clutched</em><br /><em>so tightly, and thus know fullness and freedom and joy that much sooner.</em><br /><em>We're not naturally inclined to love God and seek His Kingdom.  Trouble</em><br /><em>may help incline us - that is, it may tip us over, put some pressure</em><br /><em>on us, lean us in the right direction."</em></p><p>Matthew 6: 33But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</p>
