<p>I finally felt my first earthquake.  We were having dinner with a friend and we all felt it quake for about one minute.  Our shades were swaying, some items hanging on the wall were swinging slightly, and we could feel the sway ourselves.  But overall it was not that big of a deal.  We sat there and talked about it while it happened and the kids kept playing even though they knew what was going on.  I guess it is a part of the environment here.  If it had been a larger quake we understand that it would have been best for us to stand in a door frame.</p><p>The earthquake was a magnitude 5.1.  The center of the quake was about 45 miles south east of where we are living in Davao, Philippines.  For anyone who is interested, here is a link to more information about this particular earthquake: <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2007aja9.php">my first earthquake</a></p>
