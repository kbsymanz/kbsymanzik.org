<p>Merry Christmas from our house to yours!</p><p>It is now 11:30am Christmas morning as I write this.  </p><p>Here in the Philippines, most Christmas celebrations are held on Christmas eve.  It was quite loud last night with music, laughter, vehicles driving around.  </p><p>This morning it was wonderfully quiet as all the people who stayed up late last night slept in.</p><p>We had our own Christmas eve service at home as few, if any, churches hold Christmas eve services here.</p><p>This morning we enjoyed family time opening gifts from relatives and each other.  Now we are relaxing and enjoying some of our new gifts!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1623.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Carolers at the gate!
