<p>Well,  Jerard had no fever all day until late afternoon.<br />He even smiled about 4 times today!<br />There is talk of sending him home tomorrow or Friday.  Pray it happens!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2922.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br />But we grapple now with the care of a boy who is very weak, unable to eat except by feeding tube, very limited movement of his limbs.  Pray with us for wisdom and guidance in how best to meet his needs.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2923.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
