<p><img src="/images/legacy/3749.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="238" /></p><p>Kirsten is playing on the girls High School Soccer team.  They had another game this past Saturday.  </p><p>A friend took some great shots of Kirsten in action.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3750.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="246" /></p><p>She and the team will be traveling up to Subic the end of this month for a three day international school sports competition (<span class="caps">ISAC</span> = international school athletic competition).<br />I really appreciate the sports program offered at the school.  The athletic program strives to use athletics as a tool to enhance the athlete's academic and character development too.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3751.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="246" /></p>
