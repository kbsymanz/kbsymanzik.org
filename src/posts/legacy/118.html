<p>The pastor at our church has been preaching a powerful series on fulfilling the great commission entitled "A Passion for Missions" based on the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19 "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,  and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."</p><p>The longer we are here in the Philippines the greater the intensity of my desire to see the Great Commission fulfilled.</p><p>I found this prayer from the "Book of Common Prayer" goes a long with what he has been preaching on.</p><p>"O God, you have made of one blood all the peoples of the earth, and sent your blessed Son to preach peace to those who are far off and to those who are near:</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/286.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p> Grant that people everywhere may seek after you and find you; <p><img src="/images/legacy/379.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>bring the nations into your fold;  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/378.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>pour out your Spirit upon all flesh;</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/377.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>and hasten the coming of your kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord." -Book of Common Prayer</p>
