<p>There is a restaraunt here that serves a giant hamburger good for 8 people.  We tried it while my sister was here visiting.  The seven of us could barely eat half of it.  We brought the rest home in a doggy bag!  It is huge.  The taste was okay but we all decided we liked the McDonald's hamburgers better.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3531.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p>
