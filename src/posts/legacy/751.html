<p>I have to laugh.</p><p>Kurt and I have been praying to simplify our life and also, hopefully, move into a lower rent house that still fits our family.<br />Moving would entail ridding ourselves of excess furniture and other things as most likely the house we rent will be smaller than the one we have now.  I look forward to that.  It is so easy to accumulate stuff, even without meaning to.</p><p>A week or so ago, while Kurt and some of the kids were watching a movie at night, the television quit working.  It was a used TV when we picked it up from another missionary family over 4 years ago.  I smiled and said  "GREAT!" when Kurt told me the tv had died!!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2404.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Good bye, TV!!!!</em></p><p>Two days ago, while microwaving something, the microwave gave a loud pop and went black, no longer to work.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2405.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Good bye, microwave.  I'm thankful for more counter space!</em></p><p><em>"Simplicity is the joyful unconcern for possessions we</em> <em>experience as we truly "seek first the kingdom of God and</em><br /><em>his righteousness" (Matt 6:33).  Persons living in simplicity</em> <em>realize freedom from anxiety by viewing possessions as gifts</em> <em>from God, remembering we are stewards to care for God's</em><br /><em>gifts to us and making our goods available to others.</em><br /><em>Simplicity is a declaration of war on materialism and it</em> <em>reorients our lives, perspectives, and attitudes.</em></p><p>To simplify means "To make 'simple' or 'simpler': as a : to reduce to basic essentials b : to diminish in scope or complexity" - Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary </p><p>Living a simplified life means learning "how to say yes to the things you want in your life and no to the things you don't want in your life - your life becomes simpler."</p><p>Anyway,  it seems that part of the journey God has me on here in the mission field is to learn to prioritize what is truly important and let go of the non-essentials.  This is both in relationships, choices on how to spend my time, and on material possessions.</p><p>I'll be blogging more about my journey and our family's journey into a more simplified lifestyle!  Stay tuned!!!!!!</p><p>If you want to read more about simplifying life, check out these websites.
