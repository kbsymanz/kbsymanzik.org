<p>We recently went with a friend to a nature park about one hour from the city.  It is called Eden Nature Park.  </p><p>So, the saying goes, "move to Davao and you are between Paradise and Eden!"  (Paradise Beach on Talicud Island, Eden Nature Park one hour outside of the city.)</p><p>It really is beautiful.  I am continually amazed and awed at all God has created for us to enjoy here on earth....and it is only a shadow of things to come in Heaven!</p><p>Enjoy the pictures!  </p><p>Better yet, come visit us and we'll take you up there to see for yourself all the beautiful handiwork of God!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/238.jpg" title=""Mikayla, Kirsten, and Ben under beautiful flowers"" alt=""Mikayla, Kirsten, and Ben under beautiful flowers"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>Mikayla, Kirsten, and Ben under beautiful flowers!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/240.jpg" title=""Stream"" alt=""Stream"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>Stream!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/241.jpg" title=""The colors of flowers here are so vibrant, pictures don't do them justice"" alt=""The colors of flowers here are so vibrant, pictures don't do them justice"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>The colors of flowers here are so vibrant, pictures don't do them justice!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/242.jpg" title=""This is called a 'Spirit Tree';  I'll blog more on that later"" alt=""This is called a 'Spirit Tree';  I'll blog more on that later"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>This is called a 'Spirit Tree'; I'll blog more on that later.!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/243.jpg" title=""Our kids by bamboo"" alt=""Our kids by bamboo"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>Our kids by bamboo!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/244.jpg" title=""Our kids standing on a rock; a good reminder that our lives should be founded on The Rock"" alt=""Our kids standing on a rock; a good reminder that our lives should be founded on The Rock"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>Our kids standing on a rock; a good reminder that our lives should be founded on The Rock!</em></p>
