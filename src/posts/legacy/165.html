<p>Because of Jerard and James' birth, <br />their mother's death, <br />their aunt being willing to care for them as much as she was able, their rescue from where they were living; </p><p>my friend's ministry staff are now able to present the gospel to this community in a way they couldn't before.  </p><p>The door is opening slowly to hear of the love God has for us just as an aunt has for her nephews and foster parents have for twins not their own biological children.</p><p>God has used the birth and life of these two little boys to get  His Word into a community formally not open to Him!</p><p>As my friend, Kim, says..."all these two little ones have done is sleep, eat, and poop and look at how the Lord has used them to shine His love..."</p><p>"....think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise ...; not many were influential; ......not many from noble birth......<br /><strong>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame</strong> <br /><strong>the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame</strong><br /><strong>the strong. He chose the lowly things of this world and the</strong> <strong>despised things--and the things that are not--to nullify the</strong> <strong>things that are,</strong> so that no one may boast before him...."<br />1 Cor. 1:26-29</p><p>Pray for this community, a squatter area known as "Taa-ee" which means 'poo' in Cebuano.  It was so named by city officials because when it first was built there were no CR's in it.</p><p>Pray for Kim and her ministry staff as they share the love of Christ with this urban poor community.<br />Pray for their hearts to be open to God's Word and His love.<br />Pray for their salvation and healing.</p><p>The body of  Christ, working together, brings His love.<br />Two little boys only 3 months old are instruments of His love!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/541.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
