<p>Well, our paperwork is supposed to show up on Friday.</p><p>In the meantime Kurt has gotten sick with a fever (100 - 101.5) and doesn't feel well.  He's been sleeping most of today.</p><p>Please pray our paperwork really does show up on Friday.<br />Pray Kurt gets well.  Pray that Mikayla, Kirsten, Ben, and/or me do not get sick!</p><p>The girls are winding up their last week in school with many exams and projects, so they've been busy.</p><p>Ben and I have taken a lighter load for schooling this week to devote more time to packing, buying supplies for our helper, James, and Jerard to have while we are gone, etc.</p><p>Friday night is an end-of-year ceremony at the school to celebrate the 8th graders graduating Middle School and moving on to High School.  They have an 'after-ceremony' party til midnight then.</p><p>Knowing that God is the one who ordains all the circumstances of our lives, I am learning to rest in His love and care.  What good would fretting do anyway?</p><p>Matthew 6:27- 34 excerpts...<br />"And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?.... Therefore do not be anxious,... your heavenly Father knows that you need...but seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.  Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble." </p>
