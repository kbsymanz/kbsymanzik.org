<p>Yesterday Jerard had a CT scan of his head. </p><p>In order to do this they had to give him some anesthesia.  <br />After the CT scan we started noticing he was losing his voice and getting fussy again from his abdominal area hurting.  <br />The doctors had thought it was a temporary reaction to the medication and it would clear up by the end of the day.  </p><p>It hasn't.  </p><p>He has had a very fussy day with a hoarse and sometimes voiceless cry.  <br />There is nothing more heart-rending than seeing one so little crying with no sound coming out and seeing his face scrunched up in pain and not being able to do anything to help ease his pain.   <br />We just hold him, rock him, and pray for him.</p><p>Please keep praying for our little guy</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/557.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p>
