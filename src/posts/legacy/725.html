<p>Elisabeth Elliott has been a mentor to me for many years now (through her books).   I've never met her personally but to me she is a dear friend,a 'mother', and a mentor/encourager/friend in this journey towards our eternal home!</p><p><em>Here lies the tremendous mystery - that God should be</em> <em>all-powerful, yet refuse to coerce. He summons us to cooperation.</em> <em>We are honoured in being given the opportunity to participate in</em> <em>his good deeds. Remember how He asked for help in performing</em> <em>his miracles : Fill the waterpots, stretch out your hand, distribute</em> <em>the loaves.</em></p><p>I like this quote of hers.  It reminds me, as Jesus told us, to be faithful in the little things.  And for me these days, those 'little things' are changing diapers, exercising Jerard, playing with James and doing preschool with him, parenting all my kids for His glory, being a good wife, mom and Christian.......(Luke 16:1010 "One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much,) </p>
