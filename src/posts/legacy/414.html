<p>We traveled to Indiana this weekend to share at one of our supporting churches.  It was wonderful to spend time with the pastor and his wife in their lovely home, be able to share in the Sunday School about our work in the Philippines, listen to my husband preach a great message, enjoy potluck fellowship with church goers after the service, and then enjoy time visiting with some families at one of the member's home with pool.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1246.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>enjoying riding in the van Grandpa has loaned us for the</em><br /><em>summer.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1247.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>the van even comes with a <span class="caps">DVD</span> player!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1248.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1249.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>setting up the powerpoint display before Sunday school starts</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1251.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1252.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1253.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p>
