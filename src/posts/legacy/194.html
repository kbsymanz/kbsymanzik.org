<p><txp:article_image /><br /><em>This is Ben with a <strong>small</strong> jackfruit.  It is not ripe yet but Ben can barely lift it!</em></p><p>One of our neighbors asked me to help him pick some of of the jackfruit from the tree in front of his house.  He needed the help because he wasn't so sure about climbing into a tree and safely harvesting 40 to 50 pound fruits -- imagine that :)</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/585.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="451" /><br /><em>Our neighbor in the jackfruit tree.  In the foreground is one of the fruits.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/586.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>A closer shot of the fruit (but this one is still not ripe).  The fruit to the left that is within the white bag is the one that we actually harvested.  It was larger.</em></p><p>The fruit that we harvested weighed 46 pounds -- and yes, we only harvested one fruit.  But at that size, isn't that enough?  How much do you think that we eat over here?</p>
