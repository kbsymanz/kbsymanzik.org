<p>A year ago Jerard was in the hospital due to major siezures that left him basically immobile.  The last time I ever heard him laugh or saw him smile was a year ago March 6, 2012.  <br />It is amazing a year has almost passed since he died.<br />He's been in my thoughts more recently.  As thankful as I am that he is with Jesus, my momma's heart misses my son.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3446.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p>This hymn often plays through my mind as I think of him.<br />"I Am Jesus' Little Lamb"<br />by Henrietta L. von Hayn, 1724-1782</p><p><em>1. I am Jesus' little lamb,</em><br /><em>Ever glad at heart I am;</em><br /><em>For my Shepherd gently guides me,</em><br /><em>Knows my need, and well provides me,</em><br /><em>Loves me every day the same,</em><br /><em>Even calls me by my name.</em></p><p><em>2. Day by day, at home, away,</em><br /><em>Jesus is my Staff and Stay.</em><br /><em>When I hunger, Jesus feeds me,</em><br /><em>Into pleasant pastures leads me;</em><br /><em>When I thirst, He bids me go</em><br /><em>Where the quiet waters flow.</em></p><p><em>3. Who so happy as I am,</em><br /><em>Even now the Shepherd's lamb?</em><br /><em>And when my short life is ended,</em><br /><em>By His angel host attended,</em><br /><em>He shall fold me to His breast,</em><br /><em>There within His arms to rest.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3041.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3160.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3090.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2955.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2952.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
