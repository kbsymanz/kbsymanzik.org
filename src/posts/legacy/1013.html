<p>Meet three children who attend the church we go to.  Their families participate in the Cebuano service.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3321.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>Jorecel, John Paul, JoeyStone</em></p><p>This picture was taken at a mall they recently went to with one of the workers from the church to purchase desperately needed shoes.  Then they had soapao and coconut juice for a snack (merienda).</p><p>Each of these kids, like so many around us here, deal with struggles everyday - family struggles of mom and/or dad trying to earn enough that day to put at least rice on the table; educational struggles financially and academically; transportation struggles; housing....pray for these three and many others like them.</p>
