<p><img src="/images/legacy/3533.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br />Kurt, Ben and Kirsten recently stopped at Crocodile Park to try crocodile burgers.  They said they tasted okay but McDonald's hamburgers still rank as better choices!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3534.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3535.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3536.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3537.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br />Then to finish the meal, Kurt ordered durian ice cream made from crocodile eggs.  He is the only member of the family who likes durian (which has a taste of rotten garlic and onion).  He said the ice cream was not to bad.</p>
