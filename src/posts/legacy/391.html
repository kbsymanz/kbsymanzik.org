<p>Mikayla has graduated from 8th grade Friday evening! I'd post pictures but our download 'thingy' is packed....so just know she looked very pretty.</p><p>We will be starting our journey to the states on Saturday at 3:15pm local time here (which for Michiganders is 3:15a.m. Saturday morning).<br />We will be arriving in Detroit at 11:30p.m. Sunday.  Kurt's brother and his wife will be picking us up since they live fairly close to the airport.<br />We are looking forward to seeing our family and friends in the <span class="caps">USA</span>.</p><p>Please pray for safe travels and for Kurt to feel better.</p><p>Pray for our friend Arlene and for James and Jerard to have a safe, healthy 8 weeks while we are gone.  We will miss them.</p><p>Thanks.</p>
