<p>For those of you living in the <span class="caps">USA</span>, trying to explain the smell and taste of durian to you is an adventure.  <br />Think of garlic and rotten onions mixed together and you might have a general idea of the smell.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3221.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>hotels, hospitals and many businesses have signs that say, "no</em><br /><em>bringing in durian</em><br />Think of snail slime and you might have a general idea of the texture.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Think of eating rotten onions and garlic in the snail slime texture and burping it up for the next 24 hours or so and you'll have a general idea what the taste is like.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3228.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3229.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />People here either usually love durian or don't like it at all.<br />Some people say it smells like hell but tastes like heaven.</p><p>Personally, I've tried it three times and do not like it in any form - fresh, pie, ice cream, candy....<br />Holding one is like holding a porcupine with sharp, sharp quills!<br />You'd never want one of these to drop on your head or try to catch it while it falls!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3222.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Kurt doesn't mind it.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3233.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Mikayla is not a big fan of it.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3232.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Neither are Kirsten, Ben and James.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3226.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3234.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Our friend, Ruth, tho, loves the stuff!  So when our neighbor gave us a fresh durian off their tree, we invited her over for supper and durian! <br /><img src="/images/legacy/3231.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Durian really isn't that good for you, either.  It can raise blood pressure and cholesterol levels!!!</p><p>I prefer to eat Marong!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3220.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3235.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="176" /></p>
