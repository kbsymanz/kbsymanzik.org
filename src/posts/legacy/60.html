<p>We would like to introduce you to the latest addition to our household - Bear.  He is a two month old rottweiler puppy and we just picked him up 36 hours ago.  Everyone in the family has fallen in love with him and as you can see from the pictures, he is adorable.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/147.jpg" title=""Bear and Beth"" alt=""Bear and Beth"" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/148.jpg" title=""Bear and Mikalya"" alt=""Bear and Mikalya"" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/150.jpg" title=""Bear all tired out"" alt=""Bear all tired out"" width="300" height="225" /></p>
