And I was praying for the team</em><br /><em>to learn not only the skills of playing the game of volleyball,</em><br /><em>but also the skills of how the discipline, hardwork, etc.,</em><br /><em>of the sport can be carried over to the dailyness of living,</em><br /><em>serving the Lord with joy and gladness in all of life....</em></p><p><em>Psalm 100:1 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!</em><br /><em>2      <strong>Serve</strong> the Lord with gladness!</em>     <em>Come into his presence with singing!</em></p><p><em>3 Know that the Lord, he is God!</em>    <em>It is he who made us, and we are his;</em>    <em>we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.</em></p>
