<p>This is one of my favourite psalms.  I was reading it again today and decided to share it on our blog!!!!</p><p>Psalm 86</p><p>New International Version (<span class="caps">NIV</span>)</p><p>Psalm 86<br />A prayer of David.</p> 1 Hear me, <span class="caps">LORD</span>, and answer me,   for I am poor and needy.2 Guard my life, for I am faithful to you;   save your servant who trusts in you.You are my God; 3 have mercy on me, Lord,   for I call to you all day long.4 Bring joy to your servant, Lord,   for I put my trust in you. 5 You, Lord, are forgiving and good,   abounding in love to all who call to you.6 Hear my prayer, LORD;   listen to my cry for mercy.7 When I am in distress, I call to you,   because you answer me. 8 Among the gods there is none like you, Lord;   no deeds can compare with yours.9 All the nations you have made   will come and worship before you, Lord;   they will bring glory to your name.10 For you are great and do marvelous deeds;   you alone are God. 11 Teach me your way, <span class="caps">LORD</span>,   that I may rely on your faithfulness;give me an undivided heart,   that I may fear your name.12 I will praise you, Lord my God, with all my heart;   I will glorify your name forever.13 For great is your love toward me;   you have delivered me from the depths,   from the realm of the dead. 14 Arrogant foes are attacking me, O God;   ruthless people are trying to kill me--   they have no regard for you.15 But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God,   slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.16 Turn to me and have mercy on me;   show your strength in behalf of your servant;save me, because I serve you   just as my mother did.17 Give me a sign of your goodness,   that my enemies may see it and be put to shame,   for you, <span class="caps">LORD</span>, have helped me and comforted me.
