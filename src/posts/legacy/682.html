<p>This past weekend our mission organization had an retreat.<br />It started Friday night with a time of worship singing and dinner.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2171.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Saturday we went to Hope Mountain, a local retreat center, for a day of team building, encouragement and fellowship.</p><p>The bounce house we rented for the kids to play on was a big hit.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2172.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2173.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2174.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>I came down with a fever on Saturday afternoon and by dinner was not feeling well at all so after we got home I went to bed with a fever of 104F and other symptoms and slept most of Sunday.  My family stayed home to take care of me so we missed out on the Sunday church and lunch time.</p><p>The retreats theme was "GRACE" with the theme verse of John 1:16-17<br /><em>And from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.</em> <em>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came</em> <em>through Jesus Christ.</em></p><p>Kurt was one of the speakers on Saturday.  He will be posting the talk as a <span class="caps">PDF</span> for you to read.  I think it is an excellent talk.</p>
