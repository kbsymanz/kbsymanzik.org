<p>Ben's class has been reading the book "Sarah, Plain and Tall" and studying about life on the prairie in the 1800's.</p><p>One of their class projects was to make a log or stone cabin.  Ben had a lot of fun doing this project.  He even included an outhouse and a ladder on the roof like they used to put on in case of a chimney fire - it was easier to climb the roof with a ladder on it to put out the fire!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2444.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben with his stone house, garden and farm animals.</em></p><p>Sarah, Plain and Tall  is a tale set in the late 19th century. It is about a widowed midwestern farmer with two children, Anna and Caleb. The farmer advertises for a wife. When Sarah arrives she is homesick for Maine, especially for the ocean which she misses greatly. The children fear that she will not stay, and when she goes off to town alone, young Caleb, whose mother died during childbirth, is stricken with the fear that she has gone for good. But she returns with colored pencils to illustrate for them the beauty of Maine, and to explain that, though she misses her home, "the truth of it is I would miss you more." The tale gently explores themes of abandonment, loss and love.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2445.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="173" /><br /><em>Kansas prairie</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2446.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="178" /><br /><em>Main seashore</em></p>
