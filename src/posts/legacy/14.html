<p>Today Beth took me to the market (my first time).  What an experience!  There were many hundreds of vendors selling everything from clothing to live chickens, fresh fruits and vegetables to fresh fish, dried fish to Doritos, eggs to fresh butchered meat, and rice to the pots to cook it in.</p><p>In 30 minutes we felt as though we had just seen a small part of what was there.  Spread over many city blocks, occupying every conceivable space, the vendors were everywhere.  There was blood running in the gutters from the butchered animals.  There were plenty of sights and sounds and smells to keep ones senses working full-time.  I really enjoyed the experience.</p><p>The market is definitely the place to go to get the freshest fruits and vegetables.  Here is a list of what we purchased today:</p><ul><li>2 pineapples (one sliced and one whole - both very fresh)</li><li>6 fresh carrots</li><li>1 watermelon</li><li>2 pounds fresh picked green beans</li><li>1.5 pounds fresh tomatoes</li><li>4 cucumbers</li><li>2 pounds kalamansi (like small lemons)</li><li>10 oranges</li><li>3 mangoes</li><li>12 potatoes</li><li>20 bananas</li></ul><p>All of this was purchased for about $12 US.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/24.jpg" title=""As much of what we purchased as would fit in the picture"" alt=""As much of what we purchased as would fit in the picture"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>As much of what we purchased as would fit in the picture</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/23.jpg" title=""Beth buying bananas"" alt=""Beth buying bananas"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Beth buying bananas</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/21.jpg" title=""A fresh fish vendor"" alt=""A fresh fish vendor"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>A fresh fish vendor</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/22.jpg" title=""Another fresh fish vendor"" alt=""Another fresh fish vendor"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Another fresh fish vendor</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/25.jpg" title=""Aisle after aisle of vendors"" alt=""Aisle after aisle of vendors"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Aisle after aisle of vendors</em></p>
