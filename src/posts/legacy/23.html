<p><txp:article_image /><br />Bugs?  Yes, we have bugs.  Little ants like to crawl around in the house though I have declared chemical warfare on them in my kitchen!  <br />We do have a gecko or two in our home that are our friends.  All buildings seem to have geckos in them and people just let them stay as they eat bugs.  I think ours are doing a great job as the little ants in the bedrooms have lessened tremendously.<br />We took some pictures of a horned beetle and a snail we saw outside!<br />Thankfully I've only seen one cockroach so far and that was at the market, not in my house!!!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/42.jpg" title=""Snail"" alt=""Snail"" width="300" height="268" /><br /><em>Snail</em></p>
