<p>The Karate school Ben is going to twice a week had an exhibition at a local mall yesterday.  Ben is really enjoying the karate lessons!<br />The teacher (sen-say) is a Christian and prays at the beginning and end of each class.  He also incorporates biblical principles into the lessons and character development - self-control, perseverance, etc.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1792.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben in his karate uniform</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1793.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The students in the King's School of Martial Arts</em></p>
