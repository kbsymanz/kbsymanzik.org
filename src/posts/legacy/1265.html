This software allows them to computerize their ministry.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4053.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4054.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /></p><p>The Mercy staff are very pleased with phase one of this software.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4055.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /></p><p>Mercy Maternity has been in existence for many years and has rooms full of paper records.  This just isn't conducive to efficient patient management.  <br />Midwife-<span class="caps">EMR</span> allows for electronic record keeping for lay-in clinics.  This has been a very satisfying project that Kurt has worked on.  <em>"This project has been the most</em> <em>satisfying project that I have ever worked on in over</em><br /><em>20 years of professional software</em><br /><em>development.
