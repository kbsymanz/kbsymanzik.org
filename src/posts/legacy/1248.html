We are in Davao in the southern part, to close to</em><br /><em>the equator for typhoons to hit.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3987.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p>From http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/391446/weather/ruby-moving-slowly-across-phl-expect-second-landfall-over-masbate-pagasa</p> Typhoon Ruby (international name Hagupit) is slowly making its way across the central Philippines, moving west-northwest at 15 kilometers per hour, weather service <span class="caps">PAGASA</span> said Sunday morning.<p>In a 5 a.m. update, <span class="caps">PAGASA</span> located Ruby 40 kms northwest of Catbalogan, Samar.</p><p>At the rate it was moving, the typhoon was projected to make a second landfall over Masbate at about 10 a.m., bringing with it the danger of a storm surge of up to 3 meters.</p><p>Ruby had weakened slightly, and now has 160 kph sustained winds and gusts of up to 195 kph.</p><p>Nevertheless, <span class="caps">PAGASA</span> warned that Ruby was still dangerous as it was still a typhoon category cyclone.</p><p>Also, estimated rainfall within Ruby's 500 km diameter was from 10 - 30 mm per hour (heavy - torrential).</p><p>Ruby, as well as the northeast monsoon, will bring rough to very rough seas over the seaboards of Luzon and the Visayas; and over the northern seaboard of Mindanao.
