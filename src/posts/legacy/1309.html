<p>We received email notice today from the <span class="caps">USCIS</span> (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services)......</p><p><em>"On October 13, 2015, we <strong>denied</strong> your Form I-130, Immigrant</em> <em>Petition for Relative, Fiance(E), or Orphan, ....We mailed you a</em> <em>decision notice that explains why we denied your case and your</em> <em>options. Please follow the instructions in the notice."</em></p><p>This is extremely disappointing news to us.</p><p>So, we are waiting for the letter that explains the reasons for denial.<br />We have an immigration lawyer to contact to help us get James to the <span class="caps">USA</span>.</p><p>We'd appreciate your prayers.</p><p><em>Psalm 62: 7-9</em><br /><em>My salvation and my honor depend on God</em> (so does getting  James to the <span class="caps">USA</span> and all our life.)    <em>He is my mighty rock, my refuge.</em><br /><em>Trust in him at all times, you people;</em>    <em>pour out your hearts to him,</em>    <em>for God is our refuge.</em></p>
