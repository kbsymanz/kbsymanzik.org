<p>During the recent typhoon a few weeks ago the city's water supply line was damaged, so water has not been real consistent.</p><p>The line was fixed about a week ago temporarily so better water pressure has come.  But in the mean time, the pump that runs water into our house from the 1000 liter supply tank died.  <br />So, at night when the water pressure is higher, we fill up bukets and then use the water from the buckets for showering, doing dishes, etc.</p><p>But our landlord called last night and hopefully, today or tomorrow our pump is to be fixed!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3369.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p>
