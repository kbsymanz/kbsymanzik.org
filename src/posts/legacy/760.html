<p>I have to tell you, the <span class="caps">USA</span> place high,high value on patient privacy rights.  But here, not so.<br />I was in the doctor's office the other day sitting across the room from the receptionist.  She says, "Ma'am Beth, how old are you?"  I told her my age.  Then she asked me my weight.  Not wanting to broadcast that to the entire waiting room, I got up and sat in the chair next to her and answered her remaining questions.  I'm sure everyone could still hear, but it made me feel better to not be talking across the room at her.<br />Afterwords, I was thinking to myself, "my,how I've changed."  Four years ago I was appalled when this first happened.  But now I know it is just part of life here!<br />(I was also pleased I could answer her height and weight questions in centimeters and kilos!  That is the standard of measurement here!)</p>
