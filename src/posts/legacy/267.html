<p>Ben had a party with some friend today.  </p><p>I took them to Discovery City which is like a large McDonald's playland with slides, tunnels, ball pit, etc.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/809.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Then we ate lunch at McDonald's, came home, <br />had cake and ice cream, smashed a pinata, <br />and then watched an Indiana Jones movie.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/811.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/812.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerard is actually holding on to the toys!!!!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/813.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/814.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Tieg is like Ben's big brother.
