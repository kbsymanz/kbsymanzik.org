<p>As I post this, Japan is facing a horrendous aftermath of an incredibly strong earthquake that was only 20 miles deep.<br />Tsunamis are heading towards the Philippines, Indonesia and other islands in this region.<br />Please pray for God's peace to rest on His people, for His name to be glorified, for many to come to Him in this disaster, for good, fast relief efforts to be provided to those hit by the earthquake(s) and tsunamis.</p><p>From the US embassy "<span class="caps">TSUNAMI</span> <span class="caps">ALERT</span></p><p>The United States Embassy alerts...the possibility of a tsunami hitting the eastern shores of the Philippines following a magnitude 8.9 earthquake which struck the east coast of Japan Friday afternoon.  .....  The following coastal areas in the Philippine provinces fronting the Pacific Ocean are expected to experience wave heights of at most one meter:  Batanes Group of Islands, Cagayan, Ilocos Norte, Isabela, Quezon, Aurora, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Albay, Catanduanes, Sorsogon, Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, Leyte, Southern Leyte, Surigao del Norte, Davao Oriental, Davao del Sur.  </p><p>The first tsunami waves are expected to arrive between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., Friday (Philippine time)....."</p><p>We are on the eastern side of Mindanao but inside a bay.
