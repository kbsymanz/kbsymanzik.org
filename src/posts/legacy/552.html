<p>For the next 30 hours or so I will be gone.  I'm going on a Womens retreat that the Member Care Coordinator has organized.  There are about 40 women attending.<br />I am looking forward to this time very much.  We've had a lot of issues going on in our family recently and I'm thankful for this time to pray uninterrupted, fellowship with other women, and recharge.</p><p>Psalm 73<br /><em>21 When my heart was grieved</em>       <em>and my spirit embittered,</em></p> <em>22 I was senseless and ignorant;</em>       <em>I was a brute beast before you.</em><p><em>23 Yet I am always with you;</em>       <em>you hold me by my right hand.</em></p> <em>24 You guide me with your counsel,</em>       <em>and afterward you will take me into glory.</em> <em>25 Whom have I in heaven but you?</em>       <em>And earth has nothing I desire besides you.</em> <em>26 My flesh and my heart may fail,</em>       <em>but God is the strength of my heart</em>       <em>and my portion forever.</em> <em>27 Those who are far from you will perish;</em>       <em>you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.</em> <em>28 But as for me, it is good to be near God.</em>       <em>I have made the Sovereign <span class="caps">LORD</span> my refuge;</em>       <em>I will tell of all your deeds.</em>
