<p>Hi,  this is me, Jerard (also known as Jon-Jon),</p><p>I saw a pediatric child developmental specialist this past week.  That was an answer to prayer.  My appointment wasn't until February 16, 2009!  But she had a cancellation so I got to go early.  It was fun.</p><p>She said I am at a 4 - 5 month old developmental stage.  But in the 'performance' category I'm at 7 months development because I transfer objects from one hand to another and can pick up a toy and hold my own bottle!</p><p>Thanks for all your prayers for me.  I am getting stronger and stronger.  I love to vocalize and can be quite loud.  Yesterday it was fun to see how loud I could be in the quiet time at church.  My Mom didn't think that was so good so she took me out to the play room at church.  That was fun.  I could roll on the floor then, and vocalize!</p><p>A physical therapist will be working with me once a week at our house so I can learn to sit up better.  </p><p>My brother James likes to crawl over me when I'm lying on the floor.  I don't like that so well.</p><p>Anyway, that's my news.  Thanks for all your prayers.</p><p>Hugs,</p><p>Jerard (Jon-Jon)</p>
