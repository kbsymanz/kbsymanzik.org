<p>Kurt and I really enjoy going to Bankerohan Market near us.  It is a huge market for fruits, vegetables, meat, housewares, etc.</p><p>We took some new friends there this weekend to eat puto maya (a sweet sticky rice) at a local eatery in the market.  </p><p>If you ever come visit us, we will take you there too!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2213.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2212.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2211.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p>From a great website: http://onefilipinodish.com/blog/2008/06/puto-maya-a-cooking-lesson/<br />To make puto maya you will need the following ingredients:</p>    1/2 kilo pilit (sticky rice) and tapol (black rice)    3 cups coconut milk    1/4 kilo sugar (this was an approximation... the number seems really big to me but the little plastic bag of sugar did seem like it was about 2 cups worth)    1 tablespoon salt    3 inch piece of ginger sliced thinly sliced<p>To prepare the coconut milk mixture: boil coconut milk. Add sugar, salt & ginger. Reduce the liquid until it is rich and thick (espiso).<br />Soak the sticky rice for about 3 hours. In a steamer lined with cheesecloth pour the pre-soaked sticky rice and black rice. Cover until cooked. Once the rice is done sprinkle the coconut milk mixture and folding the rice inside the pot. Continue adding the coconut milk mixture until desired texture is achieved.</p>
