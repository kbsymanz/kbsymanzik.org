<p>When I lived in the US and would see world events unfold on the television it didn't always mean much to me.  But now that I live overseas and know people from various places all over the world, and know that our mission group has colleagues all over the world, these world events hit home deeply.<br />Some of the kids at Faith Academy have spent time growing up in Japan.  This recent earthquake and tsunami has hit very closely the hearts of many here.<br />Please continue to pray for Japan and its recovery.<br />From a Japanese colleague who sent out an email today.............<br /><em>"We are still experiencing large scale of aftershock in every one</em><br /><em>or two hours and repeated Tsunami on the coastal line.  It is not</em> <em>ended!  Waiting for rescue, recovery, and rebuild in all factors of</em><br /><em>our victims!!</em><br /><em>I was at home in Chiba near Narita International Airport the time</em> <em>earthquake hit.  First hit was incredibly shaking for over 5 minutes.</em>  <em>But I am grateful for the protection and glad to have life line in my</em> <em>area.</em></p>
