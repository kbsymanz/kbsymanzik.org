<p>Emily and Emilyn turned 18 yesterday.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1951.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Emilyn and Emily</em></p><p>They are twins who live in the area behind our house.  Their Dad, Ed, cleans our yard up once a week.<br />We are sponsoring Emily to go to University of Mindanao.  She is in her 2nd year of college and is pursuing business management degree.<br />Emilyn had dropped out of high school for a while and has now returned to finish.  She is in her 3rd year of high school at Thompson Christian School near where we live.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/881.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ed, Emily, and Emilyn from two years ago when they came to</em><br /><em>James and Jerard's first birthday party.  The younger girl in this</em><br /><em>photo is a cousin.</em></p><p>Pray for these two to grow in their Christian faith.  <br />Pray for us as we deepen relationships with these two.  They are very sweet young ladies.</p>
