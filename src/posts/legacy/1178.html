<p>I may have shared this prayer before, but I really like it and pray it often.  Especially the part about treating all that comes my way with peace of soul and remembering that all that happens is sent from God's loving sovereign hand.</p><p><em>O Lord,</em><br /><em>grant that I may meet the coming day in peace.</em><br /><em>Help me in all things</em><br /><em>to rely upon Thy Holy Will.</em><br /><em>In every hour of the day,</em><br /><em>reveal Thy will to me.</em><br /><em>Bless my dealings with all who surround me.</em><br /><em>Teach me to treat all that comes to me</em><br /><em>throughout the day with peace of soul,</em><br /><em>and with the firm conviction that Thy will governs all.</em><br /><em>In all my deeds and words,</em><br /><em>guide my thoughts and feelings.</em><br /><em>In unforeseen events, let me not forget</em><br /><em>that all are sent by Thee.</em><br /><em>Teach me to act firmly and wisely,</em><br /><em>without embittering and embarrassing others.</em><br /><em>Give me the strength to bear the fatigue</em><br /><em>of the coming day with all that it shall bring.</em><br /><em>Direct my will.</em><br /><em>Teach me to pray.</em><br /><em>Pray Thou Thyself in me.</em><br /><em>Amen.</em></p>
