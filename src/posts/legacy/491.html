<p>This date marks our 3rd year anniversary of arriving in the Philippines.</p><p>In reflecting on this my summary thoughts of our move over here are this:  </p><p><em>Never in my life have I felt so weary, so rested, so quiet, so</em><br /><em>sorrowful, so blessed, so satisfied and so thankful.</em><br /><em>Despite all the hardships, I will stay the course.</em><br /><em>I am deeper in love with my Saviour.  I know deeply the love of my</em><br /><em>Heavenly Father.  Words don't begin to describe the joy, the quiet,</em><br /><em>the resting even in the hard times, the knowing that He has</em><br /><em>everything in control.</em></p><p>I am truly thankful to be in full-time missions.  I thank God for our supporters and prayer partners who faithfully support and pray for us.</p>
