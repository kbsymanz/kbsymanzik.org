<p>James and I, along with a friend and her son, went to the market today to show it to the boys.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3268.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br />A vendor pointed at James and said, "native."  He then pointed at James' friend and said, "imported."  We all laughed! <br /><img src="/images/legacy/3267.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p> Going to the market is fun!<img src="/images/legacy/3270.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />Another vendor asked me if James was my adopted son.  I said, "yes."  Then she asked, laughingly, if I'd adopt her, too!  I just laughed, paid her for the flowers I was buying, and silently prayed for God to bless her.<img src="/images/legacy/3269.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />
