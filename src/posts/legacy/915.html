And they put nails in his feet. And the mom looked sad. Why were they so mean to him?"<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2946.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></p><p>Good opportunity to share about Jesus' love for each of us that he was willing to suffer and die for us - but the true hope and awesomeness is his risenness....</p><p>tough concept for a four year old  - for many of us - </p> do any of us truly grasp how much our <span class="caps">ABBA</span> loves us to send <span class="caps">JESUS</span> to earth to suffer and die for us so we can be forgiven of our sins and live eternally with Him????  <p>O the deep, deep love of Jesus, vast, unmeasured, boundless, free!<br />Rolling as a mighty ocean in its fullness over me!<br />Underneath me, all around me, is the current of Thy love<br />Leading onward, leading homeward to Thy glorious rest above!</p><p>O the deep, deep love of Jesus, spread His praise from shore to shore!<br />How He loveth, ever loveth, changeth never, nevermore!<br />How He watches o'er His loved ones, died to call them all His own;<br />How for them He intercedeth, watcheth o'er them from the throne!</p><p>O the deep, deep love of Jesus, love of every love the best!<br />'Tis an ocean full of blessing, 'tis a haven giving rest!<br />O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 'tis a heaven of heavens to me;<br />And it lifts me up to glory, for it lifts me up to Thee!</p>
