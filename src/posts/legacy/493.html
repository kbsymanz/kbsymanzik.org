<p>Our week has been filled with activities and sick kids.  </p><p>For 3 or 4 days James and Jerard were running temperatures.  James' got quite high.  They were both started on antibiotics and have improved tremendously since then. </p><p>Ben was also diagnosed with an ear infection and is on antibiotics for that as well.</p><p>We had planned a weekend get-away this weekend since the kids have a four-day weekend, but with illnesses running, we postponed it for a month.  </p><p>On Thanksgiving day we hosted a traditional Thanksgiving dinner for about 22 people.  It was also Kurt's birthday.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1577.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />The Birthday guy - Kurt!</p><p>Two of Kirsten's Korean friends joined us for the American Thanksgiving meal as they'd never had one before.
