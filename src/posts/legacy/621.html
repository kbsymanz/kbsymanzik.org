<p>Well, the pediatrician wanted Jerard in for one more day......tomorrow we will check him out.  (hopefully)</p><p>He has no fever.  He seems healthy.  We feel a bit frustrated by this extension. </p> The neurologist was ready to check him out today but we needed the pediatrician's approval too. <p>She wanted to observe him a bit longer due to the fever he'd just had for 24 hours.....</p><p><em>"restlessness and impatience change nothing except our peace and joy.</em>  <em>Peace does not dwell in outward things, but in the heart prepared to wait</em> <em>trustfully and quietly on Him who has <span class="caps">ALL</span> things safely in his hands.</em> <em>'Peace I leave with you; I do not give to you as the world gives' - </em><br /><em>John 14:27 NEB</em>  <cite>quote from "Keep A Quiet Heart" by Elisabeth Elliott, page 135</cite></p>
