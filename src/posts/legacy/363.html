<p>Well, the girls lost both games on Saturday but they feel like winners for doing so well against tough competition.<br /><span class="caps">ISAC</span> ended last night with a banquet for all the players and coaches.<br />Today (Sunday) they fly back to Davao.  Pray for safe travels for them.  We have missed Mikayla and it will be good to see her again!</p>
