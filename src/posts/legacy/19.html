<p>Sitting at the kitchen table last night I felt my chair and the floor swaying a bit for a minute or so.  Kurt was out jogging so he didn't notice it as he ran.  It was pretty mild but what a weird feeling to be 'sitting still' but moving.  And it reminded me of the verse Psalm 46:2-4 " Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way       and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging. There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,       the holy place where the Most High dwells." </p>
