<p>James and Jerard were both wheezing a lot this weekend.<br />Today I took them to the pediatrician pulmonologist that they've seen before.</p><p>James has new asthma medicines to take and already seems to be responding well after the first dose!<br />Jerard has been newly diagnosed with asthma but also seems to be responding well after the first dose.</p><p>We've had a 'family cold' as I've come to term it for the past 6 - 8 weeks.  We've all been coughing and having sinus drainage.  </p><p>The doctor says its from the wet, "cooler" weather we are having here. (But now that the 'ber' months have ended the rainy, "cooler" weather is stopping too. Today it's sweating weather again!!!)</p><p>Keep us all in your prayers for clear sinuses and a stop to the coughing. It gets a bit tiring to feel 'under the weather' most of the time. Thanks. </p>
