Kurt is one of those graduates.<br />Recently, some of them got together and took a picture!  They plan to send it to Taylor for their alumni news publication.</p><p>Any more Taylor Alumni wanting to come this way? (or any other college alum)?  The needs are great!</p><p>Matthew 9:35 - 38    Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. <br /><em>Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the</em> <em>workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to</em> <br /><em>send out workers into his harvest field."</em></p>
