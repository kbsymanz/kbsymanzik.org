<p>We just found out there there is a paperwork snafu regarding a certain <span class="caps">SRC</span> form (Special Return Certificate) that we need in order to properly leave the Philippines and subsequently return to the Philippines in early August.  Without getting into the details, we need your prayers that this snafu works out successfully.  Please pray that we all get the Special Return Certificates that we need before our departure on May 23rd.</p><p>Thank you for praying with us. </p>
