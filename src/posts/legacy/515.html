<p>Hi,  I am currently reading several really good books but the one I will urge you all to read in this short blog is this one..............</p><p><em>Thomas a Kempis "The Imitation of Christ"</em> </p> It is a free downloadable book at www.leaderu.com/cyber/books.<p>The second paragraph of chapter one states "The teaching of Christ is more excellent than all the advice of the saints, and he who has His Spirit will find in it hidden manna.....this is the greatest wisdom -- to seek the kingdom of heaven through contempt of the world..."</p><p>This is an excellent, thought and prayer provoking book and I recommend it highly!</p><p>Let me know what you are learning from God as you read this book!</p>
