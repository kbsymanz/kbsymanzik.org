<p>Here is an MK for you!!!!!<br />Ben, five,  recently asked me, "Mom, how do you say 'hello' in English?" as he spoke English to me. <br />I said, "Well, you are speaking English right now and 'hello' is 'hello' in English." <br />"No," he said, "I mean the other 'hello'!" <br />I said, "In Cebuano 'hello' is <span class="caps">I-O</span>."<br />'No', he said,"The other 'hello'!" <br />I said, "Ola? is that the 'hello' you are looking for?" <br />"Yes, that's the 'hello' I am looking for.....what language is that?" <br />"Spanish, honey." </p>
