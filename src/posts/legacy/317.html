<p>A word of caution when buying imported food items here....check the expiration date.</p><p>I purchased a box of cereal the other day at the store and brought it home for the kids.  I don't buy cereal to often due to the cost.<br />It had slipped my mind to check the date on the box.</p><p>As best we can tell the cereal is at least 3 years old....and stale!!!!</p><p>(Kirsten and Ben are still eating it...they say it's ok!!!!)</p>
