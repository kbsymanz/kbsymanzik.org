<p>Every year the school has a Carnival.  <br />Each grade runs a game booth.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/934.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Kirsten explaining how her grades game works.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/933.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben showing me tickets he has for playing games!</em></p><p>The 8th graders run a "Jail Booth" where people can sign other people up to be thrown in jail!</p><p>Kurt was one of the parents recruited to be jail door keeper.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/929.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Sometimes the job is rough with unwilling victims having to be wrestled into jail!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/930.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Being the sweet Mom I am I threw my daughter in jail for 5 minutes!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/931.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kurt guarding his own daughter in the jail!</em></p><p>The Carnival is a lot of fun and the proceeds go to charity.  I think this year's proceeds are either helping the families in the refugee camps around here because of the fighting on Mindanao Island, or, helping out families left homeless from recent mudslides around here.</p>
