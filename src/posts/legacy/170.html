<p>Jerard had a blood transfusion on Tuesday and it caused his hemoglobin to come up to 110 from 91.  The doctors are pleased with anything over 100.  They say that this will help him recover faster.</p><p>Jerard is on two strong anti-biotics and an anti-fungal medication to fight both kinds of infections that he has.  We did notice a slight increase in his appetite yesterday which is a good sign.</p><p>If he can go 24 hours without spiking a fever then the doctors will be inclined to release him from the hospital.  In the month that we had him, Jerard has always been running fevers on and off.  It will be nice for him to get better.</p><p>Jerard's bowels still pain him greatly.  The doctors say that this is because of the infections.</p><p>Your prayers are very much appreciated for Jerard's quick recovery.  </p>
