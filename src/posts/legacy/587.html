<p>This morning I had a lump removed from my left breast.  I will know the pathology report in about 10 days.  <br />Pray for me to heal up from this minor surgery well. </p><p>A friend asked me if I was scared about the results.  <br />No, I'm not.<br />I have a peace in my soul that comes from knowing that my Heavenly Father has everything in His control.  I am resting in His hands.</p><p><em>Isaiah 43</em> <em>1 But now, this is what the <span class="caps">LORD</span> says--he who created you, O</em> <em>Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel:</em>       <em>"Fear not, for I have redeemed you;</em>       <em>I have summoned you by name; you are mine.</em></p> <em>2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;</em>       <em>and when you pass through the rivers,</em>       <em>they will not sweep over you.</em>       <em>When you walk through the fire,</em>       <em>you will not be burned;</em>       <em>the flames will not set you ablaze.</em> <em>3 For I am the <span class="caps">LORD</span>, your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior;</em><em>...... 5 Do not be afraid, for I am with you;...</em><p>And to quote from a favourite hymn of mine.....</p><p><em>"Whate'er my God ordains is right:</em><br /><em>His holy will abideth;</em><br /><em>I will be still whate'er He doth;</em><br /><em>And follow where He guideth;</em><br /><em>He is my God; though dark my road,</em><br /><em>He holds me that I shall not fall:</em><br /><em>Wherefore to Him I leave it all.</em></p>
