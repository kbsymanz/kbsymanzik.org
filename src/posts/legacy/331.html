<p><em>"The Holy Fire of God is burning, you will walk through and not</em> <em>be burned.  You will come out a pure vessel if you let</em> <em>the Lord have his way."</em></p><p>These words, penned in the 1980's and based on Isaiah 43, are so true.  God uses "fiery experiences" to purify, teach, and train.</p><p>Today is the one year anniversary of when we received James and Jerard.  These two little guys have been a 'fiery furnace' for me, and I think, for our whole family.</p><p>Biblical truths are so much more real and true to me because of experiences we've had this past year parenting these two boys.</p><p><em>"Do not be afraid, He has called you.  He has called you</em> <em>by name, You are His. Though you pass through many waters,</em> <em>they'll not overflow for He is with you."</em></p><p><strong>Truths that have sunk deep in my heart....</strong></p><p>*He is with me - in every situation. (Isaiah 43:5)</p><p>*He guides and directs our lives - so very true.(Jeremiah 29:11)</p><p>*My real food is His word.  My life blood is prayer and worship.<br />(Matthew 4:4; John 4:24)</p><p>*He is our provider - that reality has sunk in deep here on the mission field.  Throughout Jerard's surgeries, hospital stays and medical tests funds have always appeared to pay for these.  Clothing, diapers, formula, toys have been richly supplied.<br />God has been faithful to supply our needs. (1 Tim 6:17)</p><p>*Love is a decision, not a feeling. (Luke 10:27; 1 Cor. 13:4-8)</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>We came over here on 'official' ministry.  But God has opened up so many opportunities for us in 'unofficial' minisry.  James and Jerard are our #1 'unofficial' ministry.</p> <cite>James 1:27Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and</cite> <cite>faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their</cite> <cite>distress...</cite><p>Just as God adopts us into his family, we are adopting these two boys into our family.  God has and continues to teach us so much about His love for each of us as we love and parent James and Jerard.</p><p>Yes, there have been hard times this past year.  But oh, I am so thankful for the lessons God has taught me.  The boys are a joy to us.</p><p>These two boys are our sons.  We look forward to the day when the country of the Philippines grants us adoption and we can get new birth certificates for them with the last name of "Symanzik" on them.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Thank you for all your prayers for us, for James and Jerard.  Please pray that this year, as we start filing for adoption, the process will go smoothly.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/515.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>James and Jerard on the night we received them.
