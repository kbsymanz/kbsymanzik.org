<p>It is good to meditate on the promises of God in His Holy Word.  I receive a scripture meditation from Ken Boa's ministry five times a week.  Here are reflections on the promises of God in the book of James.  from Kenboa.org</p><p>- The testing of our faith develops perseverance, and perseverance leads to maturity and completion - 1:3-4</p>   - Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows (1:17).<p>-The man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this; not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it - he will be blessed in what he does - 1:25</p> -Mercy triumphs over judgement 2:13<p>-  The wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere (3:17).</p><p>- When we submit ourselves to God and resist the devil, he will flee from us 4:7</p><p> -   When we come near to God, he will come near to us (4:8).</p>    -Whoever turns a sinner away from his error will save him from death and cover over a multitude of sins (5:20).
