<p>I just thought I'd write and tell you that though our kids have their ups and downs with the move over here, overall they are doing very well.  It is a blessing to me as a Mom to see how well they are adapting.  Praise be to God for his mercies and grace.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/36.jpg" title=""Ben in HomeSchool Gym class with friends"" alt=""Ben in HomeSchool Gym class with friends"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben in HomeSchool Gym class with friends</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/35.jpg" title=""Kirsten with Soy Yan and Joy, Friends in her 3rd grade class"" alt=""Kirsten with Soy Yan and Joy, Friends in her 3rd grade class"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten with Soy Yan and Joy, friends in her 3rd grade class</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/37.jpg" title=""Mikayla with Danielle, Jean, and Rebekah after the Middle School Choir Concert - all friends in school"" alt=""Mikayla with Danielle, Jean, and Rebekah after the Middle School Choir Concert - all friends in school"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla with Danielle, Jean, and Rebekah after the Middle School Choir Concert - all friends in school</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/38.jpg" title=""Kirsten enjoying fruit"" alt=""Kirsten enjoying fruit"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten enjoying fruit</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/39.jpg" title=""Mikayla practicing clarinet"" alt=""Mikayla practicing clarinet"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla practicing clarinet</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/40.jpg" title=""Ben with a coconut shell just broken open"" alt=""Ben with a coconut shell just broken open"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben with a coconut shell just broken open</em></p>
