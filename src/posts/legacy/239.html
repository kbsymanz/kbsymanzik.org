<p>The other day we were watching "My Big Fat Greek Wedding."</p><p>One of the opening shots is of the dad and grown daughter sitting in a car at 5 a.m. They are stopped at a red light waiting for it to turn green.  There is no other traffic around.  </p><p>I thought to myself "Why aren't they going?"  <br />Then I had to tell myself it's a US film!</p><p>Here, you'd never see anyone wait for a light unless a traffic cop is around!!!!!</p>
