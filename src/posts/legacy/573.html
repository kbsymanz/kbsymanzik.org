<p>My daughter, Kirsten, took great delight in singing "Happy half a century to you...." on my birthday Sunday.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1813.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>It was a pleasant day.</p><p>After going to church, we ate lunch at a favourite restaraunt of mine here in town called Coco's.  Then we went to Outland Adventure and went down the fastest zip line in Asia (that's what it's billed as!)<br />This is the second time I've ridden it.  It is exhilarating and fun.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1810.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben and I at the harnessing area</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1811.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>'Super Woman!'</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1812.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten, Kurt, Ben and I walking back after going on the zip</em><br /><em>line.  Mikayla took pictures and opted not to zip  as she wasn't</em> <em>feeling well.</em></p><p><em>Psalm 18: 1 I love you, O <span class="caps">LORD</span>, my strength.</em></p> <em>2 The <span class="caps">LORD</span> is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;</em>       <em>my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge.</em>       <em>He is my shield and the horn  of my salvation, my</em> <em>stronghold.......I will praise you among the nations, O LORD;</em>       <em>I will sing praises to your name.</em>
