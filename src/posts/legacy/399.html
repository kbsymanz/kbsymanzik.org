<p><img src="/images/legacy/1171.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>11 years old today!<br />What a blessing Kirsten is to us!</p><p>Kirsten,</p><p>Daddy and I have  not stopped giving thanks for you, <br />remembering you in our prayers.</p> We keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better. We pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is like the working of his mighty strength, which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can be given, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.<p>We pray this for you and all your brothers and sister.</p><p>We love you lots!</p><p>In Christ, and for His Glory,</p><p>Dad and Mom</p>
