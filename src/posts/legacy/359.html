<p><span class="caps">ISAC</span> tournaments start tomorrow.  The Boys High School basketball team along with the Girls Soccer Team left today for Manila.  The competition is held at the British International School in Manila.</p><p>Mikayla is excited and a bit nervous about this opportunity.  We will keep you posted on the team results.  They play two games each day Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  <br />Depending on how well they do they may play an additional game or two Saturday for the play-offs!  Tiring, but fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1065.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Part of the Girls High School / Middle School team.</em></p>
