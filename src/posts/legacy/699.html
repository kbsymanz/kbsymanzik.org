<p>Our friends, Janet and Ruth, invited us to dinner at their home recently.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2253.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Janet - friend and teacher at Faith</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2252.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ruth - friend and teacher at Faith</em></p><p>As I looked through the pictures I became very grateful in my heart for friends who have helped, supported, encouraged, prayed for, listened to and have just 'been there' for us.  At this time of year we are missing friends and relatives in the US but we are so grateful for the friends and 'extended family in Christ' we have here.   Our world has widened and we are so thankful to God for all his blessings!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2249.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben, Mikayla, Kirsten, JR, Lani Lou, and Lori Ann have known</em><br /><em>each other since shortly after we moved here.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Bebe and Alan - Bebe is our language and culture teacher,</em><br /><em>a good friend, a sounding board for cultural questions.
