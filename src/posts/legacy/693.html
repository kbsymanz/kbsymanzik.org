<p>Kurt is 48 today!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2144.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p>My hubby is 48 years old today! <br />He puts a smile on my face; He makes me laugh; he puts up with my moodiness. He tries to "be there" for me when I'm feeling sad or just need an extra hug. He is a stable, God-fearing, godly man who I am so thankful to be married to.  My husband is a blessing from God. <br />I'm thankful he is my life-partner on this journey God is leading us on!</p><p>Happy Birthday, Kurt!  Love you lots!!</p>
