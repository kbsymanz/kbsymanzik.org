<p>Hi,  I'm home from the hospital for a short break before going back up there for the night.  <br />Jerald is spending one more night at the hospital as early this morning from midnight - 6 or 7 a.m. he was running a fever and having loose stools frequently.  That has all cleared up now.</p><p>They'd like him 24 hours fever free.  He also lost his IV vein last night and had to get another one started.  </p><p>His head has gone down 1.5 inches since surgery.  His face is filling out and looking much like his brother's.</p><p>It looks like he will be released tomorrow morning (Sunday our time.)</p><p>I can't wait to post a photo of him for you all to share in our joy at the improvement he is making since surgery.</p><p>Pray that the visual center of his brain will develop.  He only occasionally focuses for a second on objects or faces.  Mostly his eyes wander back and forth.  </p><p>Thanks for all your prayers.</p>
