I  will have her blog soon about her experiences but she sure did enjoy it!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/100.jpg" title=""Capitan Mikayla sailing Davao Bay"" alt=""Capitan Mikayla sailing Davao Bay"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla sailing Davao Bay</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/92.jpg" title=""Mikayla with friend on Corrigador trip"" alt=""Mikayla with friend on Corrigador trip"" width="300" height="228" /><br /><em>Mikayla with friend on Corrigador trip</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/99.jpg" title=""At the mall on a rainy day"" alt=""At the mall on a rainy day"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>At the mall on a rainy day</em></p><p>Kirsten is playing soccer, enjoying school, the beach, and being creative in art and play.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/97.jpg" title=""Stacking animals"" alt=""Stacking animals"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Stacking animals</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/103.jpg" title=""Kirsten enjoying her boa"" alt=""Kirsten enjoying her boa"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten enjoying her boa</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/101.jpg" title=""Helping each other off the boat"" alt=""Helping each other off the boat"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Helping each other off the boat</em></p><p>Benjamin's stomach issues still trouble him but not as frequently as they had been.
