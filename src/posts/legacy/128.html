<p>Mikayla turns 13 today.</p><p>When she was a baby I remember praying as I held her that God would ordain the circumstances of her life and that of any future children we'd have to know that there was more to the world than "white, middle-class Americana".  God has richly answered that prayer.  What an adventure we are on.</p><p>Mikayla is growing in wisdom and grace.  She is a blessing to us and others.  </p><p>Last week she and I went on a three day mother/daughter retreat.  We had a lot of good uninterrupted talking time, time to swim, play games, and discuss various issues.  It was a very enriching time for both of us as we celebrate her entry into the teen years.</p><p>We pray that God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, will continue to give her  the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that she may know him better. We also pray that the eyes of her heart may be enlightened in order that she may know the hope to which he has called her,  the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and his incomparably great power for us who believe. </p>
