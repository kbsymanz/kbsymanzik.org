<p>This song is really good.</p><p>Listen to it at YouTube...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzI73MngRaw</p><p><strong>This Little Babe</strong> </p><p>This little Babe so few days old is come to rifle Satan's fold; <br />All hell doth at his presence quake though he himself for cold do shake; <br />For in this weak unarmèd wise the gates of hell he will surprise. </p><p>With tears he fights and wins the field, his naked breast stands for a shield; <br />His battering shot are babish cries, his arrows looks of weeping eyes, <br />His martial ensigns Cold and Need and feeble Flesh his warrior's steed. </p><p>His camp is pitchèd in a stall, his bulwark but a broken wall; <br />The crib his trench, haystacks his stakes; of shepherds he his muster makes; <br />And thus, as sure his foe to wound, the angels' trump alarum sound. </p><p> My soul, with Christ join thou in fight; <br />Stick to the tents that he hath pight. <br /> Within his crib is surest ward; <br />This little Babe will be thy guard. </p><p> If thou wilt foil thy foes with joy, <br />then flit not from this heavenly Boy. </p><p> Robert Southwell (1561-1595) </p>
