<p>Mikayla is at Camp Michawana this week with two friends from our sending church. Lydia, Mikayla, and Hannah have been friends since the girls were about 4 or 5 years old.  </p> Pray for the girls, camp counselors, and all the campers to draw closer to Christ, and have a safe, fun time in their various activities this week.<p>(Hannah wasn't at the camp yet when we checked in the girls so she is not pictured below at the check-in activities.)</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1232.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Lydia and Mikayla in front of the mess hall.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Painty hands to make hand prints on camp banner.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1231.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Making hand prints!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1233.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Lydia and Mikayla holding up their camp shirts.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1234.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>'Team Timothy' girls coming to help carry luggage up.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>The cabin they are in.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Mikayla and Lydia with their cabin counselor, Rachel.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1236.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Mikayla and Lydia on their bunks.</em></p>
