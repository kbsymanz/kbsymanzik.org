<p>I had the rare treat today of going grocery shopping with my husband!  While I have gotten used to the grocery store and by-pass many items, Kurt was intrigued by the many varied offerings on the grocery shelves.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2310.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />We picked up three such offerings and will be trying some new stuff.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2311.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />White Fungus, also called Snow Fungus is also known as white tree ear fungus, silver fungus and silver ear. It is white in color and almost transparent.  It is often used in soups and desserts.<br />I'll be checking out Chinese soup recipes to try with our white fungus!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2312.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Grass Jelly is another Chinese food.  In China, grass jelly was traditionally served with sugar syrup. Now it is often served mixed with other ingredients, such as mango, sago, watermelon, cantaloupe, and other fresh or canned fruit, and evaporated milk.<br />We'll let you know how we like it!  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2313.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Pickled Lettuce is an Asian side dish! It's a side dish to rice and meat meals.</p><p>Thank goodness for the internet to do searches for recipes to make with these items!!!!</p><p>I'll blog again after we've tried these to let you know what we thought!</p>
