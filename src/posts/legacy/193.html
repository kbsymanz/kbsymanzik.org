<p>Lizards are our friends here in the Philippines.  Here is our friend eating our enemy, the one inch long cockroach.  We keep dozens of our friends around our house at all times (as if we could do anything about it)!  Better to have our friends around than our enemies we always say :)</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/583.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
