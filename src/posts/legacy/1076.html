<p>The words to Mary Bachelor's hymn, "Go Bury Thy Sorrow" play through my mind today. <br />Thought I'd share the hymn with you:</p><p>Go bury thy sorrow, the world hath its share;<br />Go bury it deeply, go hide it with care.<br />Go think of it calmly, when curtained by night;<br />Go tell it to Jesus, and all will be right.</p><p>Go tell it to Jesus, He knoweth thy grief;<br />Go tell it to Jesus, He'll send thee relief;<br />Go gather the sunshine He sheds on the way:<br />He'll lighten thy burden--Go, weary one, pray.</p><p>Hearts growing aweary with heavier woe<br />Now droop 'mid the darkness--Go, comfort them, go!<br />Go bury thy sorrow, let others be blessed;<br />Go give them the sunshine, tell Jesus the rest.</p>
