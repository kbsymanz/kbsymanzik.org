<p>I couldn't post this earlier due to our internet not working but here is a shortened version of some thoughts I had on Easter Sunday......</p><p>First Importance</p><p>Easter 2007</p><p>Easter Sunday.  Our first in the Philippines.  I awaken with a strong case of homesickness for my home church family in MI.  I will miss hearing the organist and pianist play beautiful resurrection music.  I will miss hearing the choir sing and seeing all the Easter Lilies.  I'm also missing hugs from my many friends.  Those are the thoughts that fill my mind as we prepare to go to a combined 7 a.m. Service.</p><p>Most of the service is in Tagalog...  I pray and ask God to speak to me despite the language barriers.</p><p>There is my answer!  The Pastor is reading 1 Corinthians 15 in English and suddenly verse 3 jumps out at me..."For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also receive..."</p><p>First Importance!....Yes,  that is what it's all about.  As I look around at all my new friends in Christ I am reminded of the 'First Importance' of delivering the Word of God to unreached people groups.   How can they enjoy sweet fellowship and communion with Christ if they never hear that "Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the Third day in accordance with the scriptures..." (1 Cor. 15: 3 - 5)   in their own heart language? </p><p>So though this Easter has found me homesick..... I have been gifted by God with just enough English at this Easter service to encourage my heart.  The preacher, towards the end of his message, expounded on 1 Corinthians 15:58 to be 'steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.'</p><p>Just the Easter message I needed to hear......</p>
