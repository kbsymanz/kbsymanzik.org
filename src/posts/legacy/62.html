<p>We suspected that we might have a few rats around when the alley cats left us dead rats on our doorstep as a "welcome to the neighborhood" gift multiple days in a row.  We suspected that we might have a rat problem when a big one came in a drain pipe through the wall around our house, looked at our kids who were behind the house, and then ran away.  Of course, since rats are <strong>really</strong> common in the Philippines, we suspected that we might have a rat problem even before we moved into our new house.  The house isn't the problem - rats are just all over.</p><p>So, we bought a live trap for the rats.  We did not want a trap that would hurt our new puppy.  So far in three nights we have caught two rats.  I really think that we could have had one the first night if we had used the right bait.  We tried a 1/4 ham sandwich that we had left over - they somehow ate the meat but left the bread.  Since then we have found that they have a weakness for small strips of cooked beef that is put on the trap trigger like a worm on a hook.  That way they have to work to get it off and are more apt to trip the trigger.</p><p>After we catch then, we take them for a swim in a bucket of water.  That is the most humane way that we can think to kill them that does not risk us getting hurt in the process.  If anyone knows of a better way let us know.</p><p>Oh, by the way, we did not think that you wanted to see pictures of all this, did you?  We didn't think so.</p>
