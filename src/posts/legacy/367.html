<p>In my quiet time lately I have been meditating on Psalm 16.  <br />Ben and I are also working on memorizing this Psalm together in his Home School Bible class.<br />Join us, won't you?</p><p>It is a wonderful Psalm about God's love and faithfulness to us.<br />In His presence, truly, there is fullness of joy.</p><p><strong>Psalm 16</strong><br />You Will Not Abandon My Soul</p><p>1Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.<br />2I say to the <span class="caps">LORD</span>, "You are my Lord;  I have no good apart from you." 3As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones,   in whom is all my delight.</p><p>4The sorrows of those who run after another god shall multiply; their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out<br />or take their names on my lips.</p><p>5The <span class="caps">LORD</span> is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot.<br />6 The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;   indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.</p><p>7I bless the <span class="caps">LORD</span> who gives me counsel;<br />in the night also my heart instructs me.<br />8 I have set the <span class="caps">LORD</span> always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.</p><p>9Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure.<br />10For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol,<br />or let your holy one see corruption.</p><p>11You make known to me the path of life;<br />in your presence there is fullness of joy;at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.</p>
