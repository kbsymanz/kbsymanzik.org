<p>Please continue to pray for Mikayla.  The shingles (herpe zoster) are on the right side of her face and causing much eye swelling.  Her doctor has increased her dosage of antiviral medicines because of the concern for the health of her eye.  She has much discomfort and thankfully the pain pills help with that.  Thanks for praying.</p>
