<p>This is a typical house in the neighborhood near where we are living now.  A home that is resistant to burglary is valued as this picture shows where you see a high gate, barbed wire, and walls surround the house (not shown).  In contrast, the filipino people are extremely friendly and gracious.  One wonders about that seeming contradiction of crime and kindness.  Maybe it has to do with poverty rather than greed.</p>
