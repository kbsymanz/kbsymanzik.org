<p>Hi,  Thought I'd share a more recent photo of us as a family!  <br />Mikayla has really gotten tall this past year.  <br />Kirsten and Ben have each added an additional inch or two in height also.</p><p>We've been through many changes this past year and we thank God for all our friends and family supporting us to be here!</p><p>Kurt and I really enjoy our work here.  The kids are thriving and doing well.  We thank God for His blessings.  May all we do and say be to His Glory!</p><p>Blessings to each of you at this holiday time!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/479.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/480.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/481.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/482.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p>
