<p>In the 1930's Battle of the Books (B.O.B) was a Chicago radio program. Today it is a reading incentive program in elementary, middle and high schools across the <span class="caps">USA</span>.  </p><p>The Librarian here at Faith has been running the Battle for the past few years for the 3rd - 7th graders.   Its a voluntary program.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1746.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Miss Van explaining the rules of the competition.</em></p><p>Kirsten chose to be in it this year and she had to read many books.<br />She enjoyed reading the various selections.</p><p>Today the Battle played out!</p><p>All of the questions in the competition begin with the words "In which book" and the correct answer is always the title and author of the book.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1748.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Kirsten's team won the 6th and 7th grade competition.<br />It was enjoyable to watch the battle!

Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.</p>
