<p>Beth and I brought Jerard home from the hospital today. We are very happy that he is home. This latest hospital stay was for 8 days, with the latter half of the stay trying to get his progressive pneumonia under control.</p><p>He still has a bunch of medications (10 in all) that he has to take, including one through IV (through the use of a heparin lock), and the rest through a feeding tube. He is still <span class="caps">NPO</span> (meaning nothing by mouth) so he gets a milk formula every three hours along with whatever medicine he is due for.</p><p>Thank you all for your prayers. We really appreciate them and still need them very much.</p>
