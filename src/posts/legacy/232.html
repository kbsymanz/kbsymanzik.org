<p><img src="/images/legacy/662.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Jerard is just starting out eating rice cereal and squash.  He has been making many improvements in health and motor activity since his last hospital stay.  He smiles more, plays with toys, sits in the johnny jump up seat recently sent to us, coos, eats more.  It is a blessing to see the improvements.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/663.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>James enjoys wearing his food almost as much as eating it!  Actually, he is so active, even with a spoon in his mouth, he bounces and food ends up smeared on his face!  He loves squash, papaya, rice, tuna, oatmeal, banana, etc.</p>
