<p><img src="/images/legacy/1688.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Friday afternoon Jerard came down with a fever and slight cough.</p><p>By yesterday afternoon his fever was continuing and his cough much worse.<br />He has been sleeping a lot this weekend and today.  His appetite is down, too.  We've had to work at pushing fluids so he doesn't get dehydrated.  <br />He's been letting us know he does not feel well.</p><p>Today he was started on a strong antibiotic for pneumonia.  <br />It is also such a blessing to have a great Christian doctor across the street from us!  </p><p>Keep Jerard in your prayers.  Thanks!</p>
