<p>Thought I'd share a photo diary of some events from our week with you all!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/683.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Our good friends left Davao this week to move to Nepal.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/682.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kids at our friends' gate.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/684.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten with two friends celebrating her birthday early before they go visit relatives in Korea for the summer break.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/686.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James pulls himself up to standing now and is starting to crawl well.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/685.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla and Bear.  Mikayla is enjoying the slower pace of summer life.  She's finding time to knit, read what she wants to, and play more with Bear.  She's also helping me get back in shape with morning workouts!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/687.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben has inherited 3 box turtles from two families who've left Davao.  He and 'Gardner Mike' are building a turtle corral in the yard with bamboo.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/688.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Arlene arranging flowers for a group meeting and dinner.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/689.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mom and Jerard.  Jerard rolled over by himself on Friday!  He is making much progress and now weighs almost as much as his brother, James.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/690.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Dear friends from church, Rosario and Michael.  It was Rosario's birthday today and they hosted a Thanksgiving Celebration in her honor.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/692.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The party was no small gathering!  Michael and Rosario held it on the grounds of one of the companies they own and operate.  It was very festive.  Lunch included traditional birthday foods of lechon (roast pig), lechon manok (roast chicken), spaghetti and pancit.  You'll notice many people are wearing red shirts; red is the Chinese color for happiness and is worn for parties, Chinese New Year, and other celebrations!.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/691.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>A view of the ocean and beach from the birthday party area.</em></p>
