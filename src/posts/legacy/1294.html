<p>We are in a season of more frequent power outages, lasting 1 - 2 hours once or twice a day.  Yesterday, our son, James, made us laugh when, after the power went out, he walked over to the piano, played a couple of the keys and exclaimed in great relief, "it still works!"</p><p>He is so technologically minded that the thought of something working without power seems to amaze him!!!</p>
