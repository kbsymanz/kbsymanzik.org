 Kurt and I were asked to take a week long training on Peer Debriefing.  <p>So, I can hear the question "What is Peer Debriefing?"</p><p>Debriefing is often referred to as "emotional first-aid" for someone who has been through a traumatic or difficult experience.  It is <span class="caps">NOT</span> counseling or therapy, but rather a helpful process to walk through with someone (... a peer of yours who has been trained).  The goals of debriefing are to mitigate the negative impact of the event as well as help the person recover more quickly and more fully than they would otherwise.    In many ways, debriefing is a very practical & effective way of putting into practice the Biblical mandate to "bear one another's burdens," particularly with traumatic events. </p><p>Psalm 23 (God's loving presence) along with Psalm 22 (God's absence when one is suffering) and I Cor. 12:12, 14, 25-27 (need for one another) remind us that we are members of a body. We need one another, and when one member suffers, we all suffer. God is indeed our Shepherd, but even the Lord Jesus felt distanced from God the Father at times. And he chose the disciples, not only to train them, but to have them with Him as friends (Mk. 3:14).</p><p>On Friday July 13 we are flying up to Manila and then taking an 8 hour bus trip up to Bagabag where the training will be held.  Our children are traveling with us.  We look forward to seeing more of the Philippines.  We will be in Bagabag July 14 - 23.  </p><p>Monday - Friday we will be in training while our kids will be with a child care worker swimming, playing, etc.  After our conference is over we will be visiting an allocation with a National Translator and also seeing the infamous Banaue Rice Terraces.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/265.jpg" title=""Banaue Rice Terraces - 8th wonder of the world!"" alt=""Banaue Rice Terraces - 8th wonder of the world!"" width="300" height="205" /> <em>Banaue Rice Terraces - 8th wonder of the world.</em></p><p>Pray for us while we travel, for safe travels, good health, that we learn what we need to at our conference.</p>
