<p>Saturday, June 19, our daughter Kirsten turns 12!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1867.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>She is a blessing to us.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1866.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>She requested to go to Isla Reta, a beach campground, for her birthday weekend.  We are going there today and look forward to a "family retreat" and fun at the beach.</p><p>Kirsten, Daddy and I  have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.  We keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.  We pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, 19and his incomparably great power for us who believe. (Ephesians 1: 16-19)</p>
