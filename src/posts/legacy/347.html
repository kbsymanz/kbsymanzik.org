<p>Rachel is still in the hospital.  Her fever has gone down.  She has pneumonia and they are still doing one more test to confirm if she has dengue.  She continues to have stomach upset and doesn't sleep well.  The only food she is able to keep down without problems are bananas and apples.<br />Keep her and her Mom in your prayers.  Thanks.</p>
