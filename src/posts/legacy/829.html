 Yesterday, the pastor at the church we attend preached on hiding God's word in your heart.  I was convicted to start working on that again.  I tend to 'go in spurts' as to working on hiding God's word in my heart....Psalm 19 is a good reminder as to why knowing God's word is so important...<p>Psalm 19: 7 The law of the <span class="caps">LORD</span> is perfect,   refreshing the soul.<br />The statutes of the <span class="caps">LORD</span> are trustworthy,   making wise the simple.<br />8 The precepts of the <span class="caps">LORD</span> are right,   giving joy to the heart.<br />The commands of the <span class="caps">LORD</span> are radiant,   giving light to the eyes.<br />9 The fear of the <span class="caps">LORD</span> is pure,   enduring forever.<br />The decrees of the <span class="caps">LORD</span> are firm,   and all of them are righteous.</p> 10 They are more precious than gold,   than much pure gold;they are sweeter than honey,   than honey from the honeycomb.11 By them your servant is warned;   in keeping them there is great reward.12 But who can discern their own errors?   Forgive my hidden faults.13 Keep your servant also from willful sins;   may they not rule over me.Then I will be blameless,   innocent of great transgression. 14 May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart   be pleasing in your sight,   <span class="caps">LORD</span>, my Rock and my Redeemer.Footnotes:
