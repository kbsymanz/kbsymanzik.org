<p>I just wanted to let you know I am 23 inches long and weigh 4.4 kilos - which in pounds equals 9.7 pounds.  I weighed about 4 pounds when I was born.  So did my brother.</p><p>I like to smile a lot.  I also like to be on my tummy and try to push with my arms.  My parents have a big pillow I lay on and often times I push myself off that pillow.  Soon I'll be rolling!!!!</p><p>While my brother is in the hospital, I spend my days with my 'Aunt' Louise and her two kids, Ewan and Lydia.  I like the toys at her house!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/559.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>This is Lydia and I</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/558.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>This is me playing with toys at Aunt Louise's house</em></p><p>Thanks for all your prayers for me and my brother.</p>
