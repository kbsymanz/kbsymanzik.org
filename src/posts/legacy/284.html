<p>"For all the blessings of the year,<br />For all the friends we hold so dear,<br />For peace on earth, both far and near,<br />We thank Thee, Lord.</p><p>For life and health, those common things,<br />Which every day and hour brings,<br />For home, where our affection clings,<br />We thank Thee, Lord.</p><p>For love of Thine, which never tires,<br />Which all our better thought inspires,<br />And warms our lives with heavenly fires,<br />We thank Thee, Lord."</p><p>I tend to think in music lyrics...especially hymns.  The above hymn and also the chorus, "Lord of all to Thee we raise, this our hymn of grateful praise" have been playing in my mind lately.</p><p>A couple days ago James and Jerard were blessed with the gifts of a playpen, toys, numerous textured balls, formula, and diapers from a friend here in Davao.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/838.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/839.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>The noisy toys have been great for Jerard.  He happily listens to them, feels the textured balls, and seems to really enjoy the new sounds and feels.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/841.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/842.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Unexpected blessings like these toys, especially the noisy ones that help Jerard interact with his world, remind me of how much God loves us.  I'd been praying for a way to get noisy toys  for Jerard as part of his physical and developmental therapy....and wow,  God answered in a big way!...."Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father;<br />There is no shadow of turning with Thee;<br />Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not;<br />As Thou hast been, Thou forever will be.</p><p>Great is Thy faithfulness!<br />Great is Thy faithfulness!<br />Morning by morning new mercies I see.<br />All I have needed Thy hand hath provided;<br />Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!"</p> There is no concern to small for him.  He cares for the sparrows....He cares about  toys that will help a little boy who is blind.<p>"For the joy of human love,<br />Brother, sister, parent, child,<br />Friends on earth and friends above,<br />For all gentle thoughts and mild.<br />Lord of all to Thee we raise, <br />This our hymn of grateful praise."</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/843.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/840.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James is patiently waiting for us to put batteries in the train!</em></p>
