<p>Well,  we now have a teen ager in our family! </p> Her birthday party was a lot of fun.  <p><img src="/images/legacy/406.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>We are thankful to God for each one of our kids!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/405.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>We are also thankful to all our friends and family for your prayers, support, letters, packages....we are truly blessed.</p> "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  I always thank God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.  For in him you have been enriched in every way--in all your speaking and in all your knowledge...Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.  He will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.  God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful."1 Corinthians 1 : 3 - 8
