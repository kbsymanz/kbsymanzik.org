<p>Faith Academy High School had a girls retreat Wednesday night through early this afternoon.<br />Mikayla really enjoyed the retreat.<br />I was blessed to be able to share about relationships with the girls.<br />I am thankful for these opportunities our kids have to develop their own spiritual relationship with their Saviour Jesus Christ.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2447.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>Praise and Worship</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2448.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>Talking</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2450.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>More talking!</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2449.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>Learning to make Kimbop</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2451.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
