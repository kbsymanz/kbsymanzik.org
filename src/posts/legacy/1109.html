<p>James watches his brother's video and says to me this morning, "I miss my brother."<br />He says that often.<br />It's hard for a little boy to grieve the loss of his friend and brother.<br />He and I talk about Jerard and James tells me what he remembers - Jerard's laugh, the seizures, playing with him.<br />I hug James and we talk about Jerard.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2955.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3172.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3173.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3133.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2954.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3098.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3093.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2945.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2931.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2306.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2287.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>We share memories, I give James many hugs.<br />He's glad Jerard can see in Heaven but he misses his brother here on earth.<br />Pray for James as he continues to process the loss of his brother.</p>
