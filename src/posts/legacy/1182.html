<p>Thought I'd share a quote with you  from "A Praying Life"  by Paul Miller, pg 72-73.....a continuation in learning that in the wrestling is rest.  In the centre of the storm is peace.  Ours is but to trust and obey.</p><p><em>"When you stop trying to control your life and instead allow</em><br /><em>your anxieties and problems to bring you to God in prayer,</em><br /><em>you shift from worry to watching.</em><br /><em>You watch God weave his patterns in the story of your life.</em><br /><em>Instead of trying to be out front, designing your life,</em><br /><em>you realize you are inside God's drama.</em><br /><em>As you wait, you begin to see him work, and your life begins</em><br /><em>to sparkle with wonder. You are learning to trust again."</em></p>
