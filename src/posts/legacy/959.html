<p><img src="/images/legacy/3119.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James asks/states "Jerardy's not in there!?  Jerardy died." as he</em><br /><em>looks at this recent photo taken while we were at Eden Nature Park.</em><br /><em>And sadness etches on his face.  Tears are in his eyes.</em><br /><em>He accepts a hug from me, runs off to get his Tigger, returns</em><br /><em>to my lap and snuggles for a while.</em></p><p>Pray for James and for all of us as we process our grief at the loss of Jerard.</p>
