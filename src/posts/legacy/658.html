And we are quite international - Ireland, Korea, Germany, New Zealand, and USA!!!!!</p><p>We are currently studying the book of Proverbs.</p><p>Today, we had the Bible Study at my house.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2008.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2009.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2010.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2007.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Beth was laughing as I and another mom took her picture with her</em><br /><em>son, Luke, sound asleep in her arms!
