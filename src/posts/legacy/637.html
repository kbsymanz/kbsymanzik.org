<p>Wow, time flies!  I hadn't realized it'd been 8 days since my last post.  Sorry, I don't like to go that long between posts!</p><p>We've had a sinus infection virus attacking each of us in varying degrees.  Mikayla was sick enough to have to miss the High School Retreat that they annually take early in the start of the school year.  Just yesterday she was finally starting to feel a bit better.</p><p>Kurt has been busy working on programming needs for the Asia Area.  He's also been helping friends of ours with their website for their ministry.  Check it out at http://www.reachinternationalhealthcareandtraining.com/<br />(or better yet - wait at least 24 hours from this post to check the new website.  If you check it now it will be the old site.)</p><p>We are thankful to be here on the mission field and appreciate all your prayers!</p><p>I'll post again sooner than 8 days from now!!!!:)</p>
