<p>This prayer, by Jeremy Taylor, 1613-1667, comes from the book "Valley of Vision."  Its an excellent read!</p><p><em>"Almighty God, give to Thy servant a meek and gentle spirit that may</em><br /><em>be slow to anger and easy to mercy and forgiveness.  Give me a wise</em><br /><em>and constant heart, that I may never be moved to an intemperate</em><br /><em>anger for any injury that is done or offered.</em><br /><em>Lord, let me ever be courteous, and easy to be entreated;</em><br /><em>let me never fall into a peevish* or contentious spirit, but follow peace</em><br /><em>with all men; offering forgiveness, inviting them by courtesies, ready</em><br /><em>to confess my own errors, apt to make amends,</em><br /><em>and desirous to be reconciled.</em><br /><em>Let no sickness or cross accident, no employment or weariness</em><br /><em>make me angry or ungentle and discontented, or unthankful, or</em><br /><em>uneasy to them that minister to me, but in all things make me like</em><br /><em>unto the holy Jesus.  Amen.</em></p><p>footnote:*"peevish" is an old English word meaning   <br />1.cross, querulous, or fretful, as from vexation or discontent: a peevish youngster.<br />2. showing annoyance, irritation, or bad mood: a peevish reply; a peevish frown.<br />3. perverse or obstinate.</p>
