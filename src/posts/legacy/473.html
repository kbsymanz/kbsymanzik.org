<p>I read an interesting poem in a new book I just bought called,  "The Church and Poverty in Asia" edited by Lee Wanak.  The book opens with this poem.</p><blockquote style="text-align:center;"><p style="text-align:center;"><em>If you want to help the poor, you must disciple the rich.</em><br /><em>If you want to help the rich, you must understand their poverty.</em><br /><em>If you want to help both poor and rich, you must believe in the abundance of Christ.</em></p></blockquote><p>Focusing for a moment on the second line, "what is the poverty of the rich?"  Are the rich in anyway poor?  If so, in what ways are the rich poor?</p><p>What do you think?</p>
