<p>Jeepneys are a very common Philippine form of transportation along the lines of the US busline.  They each follow a predefined route and for 7 pesos one can get on and get off at whatever point is needed.  They are a really cost effective means to get around town as long as the routes take you close to where you want to go.</p><p>So far though, I have a tendency to get sick to my stomach while riding them.  I suspect that this is a combination of the heat, the vehicle fumes, the low windows which force one to lean over low to see where we are, etc.  I have always been an easy target for motion sickness so maybe it is just me. </p>
