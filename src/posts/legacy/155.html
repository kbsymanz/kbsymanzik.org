<p>Well,  I took Jerald to the pediatrician on Monday.  <br />After lab work and a chest x-ray was done it was discovered he has pneumonia.   <br />Now he is on an antibiotic.  <br />The lab work will get repeated on Saturday.  <br />If his infection is clearing up, then we can get surgery scheduled.</p>
