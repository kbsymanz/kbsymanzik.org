<p>Today (Wednesday June 15), I had a young woman fall at my feet in sorrowful, repentant tears begging forgiveness.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2546.jpg" alt="" width="377" height="573" /></p><p>As I sat with her head on my lap, rubbing her back as she wept sorrowfully for her failings, I could not help but think of my Sovereign Saviour, Jesus, having His feet washed with the tears of a repentant woman.</p><p>As she wept I thought of all the times I have wept bitterly over my mistakes and shortcomings.  I thought of how often I have begged for forgiveness from my Heavenly Father.</p><p>My heart prays and breaks and compassionately loves this girl.</p><p>How could I not forgive her?!</p><p>We'd been helping her go to school to better her life.<br />She has put herself in the unenviable position of being an unwed, pregnant teenager. her life is much harder now with a new life forming inside her.</p><p>She is very ashamed.  It was very hard for her to come tell us what had happened.  She broke her promise and our trust.<br />Her course in life has changed drastically.</p><p>Of course I forgive her.<br />How can I not?<br />He forgives me so much.<br />I have made many mistakes myself.<br />May <span class="caps">HIS</span> compassion flow.</p><p>Please pray for this girl.  She is two months pregnant.  Pray for her baby.  Pray the love of Jesus Christ penetrates her heart and she comes to know the love of Jesus as her own.</p><p><em>God loves a lullaby</em><br /><em>In a mothers tears in the dead of night</em><br /><em>Better than a Hallelujah sometimes.</em><br /><em>God loves a drunkards cry,</em><br /><em>The soldiers plea not to let him die</em><br /><em>Better than a Hallelujah sometimes.</em></p><p><em>We pour out our miseries</em><br /><em>God just hears a melody</em><br /><strong><em>Beautiful the mess we are</em></strong><br /><strong><em>The honest cries of breaking hearts</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Are better than a Hallelujah</em></strong></p><p><em>...The tears of shame for what's been done,</em><br /><em>The silence when the words won't come</em><br /><em>Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes.</em></p><p><em>We pour out our miseries</em><br /><em>God just hears a melody</em><br /><strong><em>Beautiful the mess we are</em></strong><br /><strong><em>The honest cries of breaking hearts</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Are better than a Hallelujah</em></strong></p><p>Luke 7:36-50<br />Now one of the Pharisees was requesting Him to dine with him. And He entered the Pharisee's house, and reclined at the table. And behold, there was a woman in the city who was a sinner; and when she learned that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster vial of perfume, and standing behind Him at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears, and kept wiping them with the hair of her head, and kissing His feet, and anointing them with the perfume. Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him, that she is a sinner." And Jesus answered and said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." And he replied, "Say it, Teacher." "A certain moneylender had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty. "When they were unable to repay, he graciously forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him more?" Simon answered and said, "I suppose the one whom he forgave more."<br />And He said to him, "You have judged correctly."<br />And turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair. "You gave Me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet. "You did not anoint My head with oil, but she anointed My feet with perfume. "For this reason I say to you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little." And He said to her, "Your sins have been forgiven." And those who were reclining at the table with Him began to say to themselves, "Who is this man who even forgives sins?"<br />And He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."</p><p>-Luke 7:36-50</p>
