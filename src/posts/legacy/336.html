Seeking <span class="caps">FIRST</span> His Kingdom and His Righteousness!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/992.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/993.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/994.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><em>an excerpt from this morning's talk</em></p><p>"James 1:27Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress... <br />Just as God adopts us into his family, we are adopting these two boys into our family. God has and continues to teach us so much about His love for each of us as we love and parent James and Jerard........God takes us in as we are.....<br />Adopting babies, especially ones with health problems, is like that....asthma, hydrocephalic, blindness aside...we love them.  <br />In caring for them I am ever more and more thankful for God's love for me; for each of us...........<br />Hebrews 12: 28Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, 29for our "God is a consuming fire."" </p>
