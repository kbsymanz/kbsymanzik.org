<p>Mikayla is on the High School/Middle School Girl's Soccer Team.<br />They will be traveling to Manila the end of this month for <span class="caps">ISAC</span> Tournaments (International Schools Activities Conference).  She is very excited.  She plays defense and goalie.</p><p>The girls were supposed to play a travel team today but that team canceled out a few days ago.  The coach asked the Moms if they'd be willing to play against their daughters to give them some practice.  So some of the Moms and some of the mid-wives from Mercy Maternity Clinic played against the girls today.<br />I went into the game figuring the girls would trample us but we did well against them.  Final score was 4 - 2.<br />It was a lot of fun playing.  Some of us ladies decided to try and start a women's soccer team to play once a week.  I may have to buy some soccer cleats now!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1031.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Me playing on the "Raging Mommas" team</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1033.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Some of our team</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1032.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla in action as defense</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1034.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla in goalie position</em></p>
