<p>One of my summer goals is to teach each of my children cooking skills.</p><p>James loves mixing up cookies, cake, bread dough, etc.  The other day he helped me make tortilla shells.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3856.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p>Each child is assigned making supper one night per week.  The other night Ben, with my assistance, made chicken fingers.  He didn't like the hot oil spatter but he did an excellent job on the meal.  He also recently made shoyu chicken - the recipe is listed below, along with a bread stick recipe and a tuna boat recipe which is a family favourite!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3857.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p>Kirsten and her friend, Joy, recently made delicious chocolate chip cookies.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3848.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p>James and his friends Whit and Sojo recently made fun-shaped breadsticks with the help of Mikayla!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3858.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p><strong>Breadsticks</strong></p><p>4 cups all-purpose flour <br />1 1/2 tablespoon baking powder <br />1 teaspoon salt <br />4 teaspoons sugar<br />1/2 cup olive oil or melted butter<br />3/4 cup milk <br />Mix together well.
