<p>Just as God commanded the Israelites in Joshua 4 to gather stones of remembrance,<br />and as He had them place stones of remembrance in the priests' robes (Exodus 28 and 39),<br />we, too, have stones of remembrance for Jerard.</p><p>The day after Jerard was buried, James and I encircled the grave site with stones.  We also brought some of them home as a remembrance of Jerard.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3132.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p>Today, when I visited the grave site, I was pleased to find his grave stone had been placed on his grave. <br /><img src="/images/legacy/3133.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>2 Cor. 5:8...to be absent from the body, and to be present</em><br /><em>with the Lord.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3134.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p>Glad Jerard is present with Jesus.  But missing him deeply here.</p>
