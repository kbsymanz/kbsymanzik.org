We are learning the art of substituting ingredients since some of the items called for in recipes we haven't found here (yet...)</p><p>Mikayla has become the resident popcorn maker for the family.  She has perfected the art of stove top kettle  popping, unlike her Mom who tends to burn it every time!!!</p><p>I thank God for the daughters He has given me!</p>
