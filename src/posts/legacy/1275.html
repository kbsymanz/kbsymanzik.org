<p>John Ortberg has written an excellent book, "Love Beyond Reason."</p><p>Here's a quote from it.</p><p><em>"Grace providers notice things about you; they pay attention</em><br /><em>to your heart and life.</em><br /><em>Grace providers speak truthfully  to you - both easy words and</em> <em>hard.  Grace providers are not people who only say what you</em><br /><em>want to hear, but they speak the truth in love.  Grace providers</em> <em>simply never cease to love you.  They see beneath the surface;</em> <em>they see the darkness as well as the goodness in your heart.</em><br /><em>But when they see the darkness they do not pull away.</em><br /><em>They are not repulsed.  They move toward you.  You may be a</em><br /><em>rag doll, but you are God's rag doll, and grace providers</em><br /><em>never let you forget it."</em><br />( Love Beyond Reason, John Ortberg.  Kindle Cloud.)</p><p>May we each be providers of grace to those around us- like it says in 1 Thessalonians 5: 13- 15 <em>"... Be at peace among yourselves.</em><br /><em>And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, <strong>encourage</strong></em><br /><em>the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all.</em><br /><em>See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek</em><br /><em>to do good to one another and to everyone.</em></p>
