<p>Quite a while ago my sister had sent me a CD of piano music by her church's pianist, Barb Bamberg.  It is a beautiful, relaxing CD of hymns titled "Sing Them Over Again."</p><p>In 1 Samuel 16 verse 23 it says <em>And whenever the harmful</em><br /><em>spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre and played</em><br /><em>it with his hand. So Saul was refreshed and was well, and the</em> <em>harmful spirit departed from him.</em></p><p>I would reword that a bit to say that "<em>when the enemy tries to</em> <em>discourage me to much due to many things we are dealing with</em> <em>at this time of our life I take my music CD of "Sing Them Over</em> <em>Again" by Barbara Bamberg, listen to it, and am refreshed in my</em> <em>spirit."</em></p>  I love listening to the hymns.<p>Music is such a gift.  This CD ministers to James too.  He often asks to listen to it at night while he is preparing to fall asleep.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3434.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200" /><br /><em>Barbara Bamberg, Pianist at St. Luke's United Methodist Church</em><br /><em>in Houston, Texas.</em><br />I wanted to encourage you to get a copy of her CD if you can.  I checked at Amazon but it doesn't seem available there.  So, contact her at the church, St. Luke's United Methodist Church in Houston, Tx.<br />http://www.stlukesmethodist.org/pages/staff</p>
