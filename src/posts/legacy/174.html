<p>The neurosurgeon was pleased to see that the visual center of the brain is there on Jerard's CT he had today.  There is also more brain showing in other areas of his skull than showed up on the CT prior to surgery for the shunt.</p><p>Some areas of brain, though, are not developed at all.</p><p>There is no sign of abscess in his brain which is why the CT was done today.</p>
