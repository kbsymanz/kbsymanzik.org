<p>Beth just came back from the operating room where the doctors talked with her immediately after the surgery.  The surgery went well.  The first shunt was removed and the infection appears to have been limited to the outside of the skull around the shunt.  They are running cultures to determine if there is any infection in the cerebral fluid.  It will take a couple days for those results to come back.</p><p>In the meantime, the doctors are hoping that the remaining shunt will be able to drain the cerebral fluid for all of the ventricles.  Whether that  is the case or not should be evident within about 4 days or so.  If the remaining shunt does not properly drain all of the ventricles then another operation will be required to install another shunt.</p><p>Please pray:</p><ul><li>That Jerard's infection clears up soon.</li><li>That the current shunt is sufficient for draining the whole ventricular system.</li><li>That Jerard's brain continues to grow.</li><li>That the hospital stay is no longer than it needs to be.</li></ul>
