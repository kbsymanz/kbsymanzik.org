<p>Yesterday, while on a boat trip in Davao bay, we saw a pod of dolphins.  A couple of them came and swam right along side the boat.  It was so cool.  God's creations are awesome.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3985.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="216" /></p><p>One of the boat crewmen had us clap and as we did the dolphins swam next to the boat keeping up with the boat's speed.  When we stopped clapping they'd go away a bit.  This went on for a few minutes and then they all swam off.</p><p>While I've seen dolphins in the bay before, this was a first to have them swim along side the boat.  So cool.  <br /><img src="/images/legacy/3986.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="180" /> </p>
