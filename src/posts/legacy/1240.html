<p>James turned 7 yesterday (10/26/14).  Today we picked up his passport.  He is really hoping during his 7th year of life he travels to the USA!  We are thankful for James and pray he continues to grow in wisdom and grace, seeking first God in all his ways.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3914.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3915.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3916.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p>
