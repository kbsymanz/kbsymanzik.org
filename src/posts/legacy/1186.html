<p>James has been asking when his adoption will be completed.<br />He'd like to see the area where he first lived here in Davao but we've been advised not to go there until the adoption is complete.<br />Pray we will here a favourable decision regarding James' adoption soon.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3712.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p>And pray for James.  He really misses his brother, Jerard, as do I.<br />I am so thankful James has clear memories of his brother.  James was sharing some of his memories of Jerard with me today.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3713.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2585.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Sometimes when I think of Jerard the lyrics to the song "To Where You Are" by Josh Groban go through my head.  There is not a day that goes by I don't think of my little visitor from heaven, so thankful he came.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2777.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>"To Where You Are"</p><p>Who can say for certain<br />Maybe you're still here<br />I feel you all around me<br />Your memory's so clear</p><p>Deep in the stillness<br />I can hear you speak<br />You're still an inspiration<br />Can it be<br />That you are mine<br />Forever love<br />And you are watching over me from up above</p><p>Fly me up to where you are<br />Beyond the distant star<br />I wish upon tonight<br />To see you smile<br />If only for awhile to know you're there<br />A breath away's not far<br />To where you are</p><p>Are you gently sleeping<br />Here inside my dream<br />And isn't faith believing<br />All power can't be seen</p><p>As my heart holds you<br />Just one beat away<br />I cherish all you gave me everyday<br />'Cause you are my<br />Forever love<br />Watching me from up above</p><p>And I believe<br />That angels breathe<br />And that love will live on and never leave</p><p>Fly me up<br />To where you are<br />Beyond the distant star<br />I wish upon tonight<br />To see you smile<br />If only for awhile<br />To know you're there<br />A breath away's not far<br />To where you are</p><p>I know you're there<br />A breath away's not far<br />To where you are</p>
