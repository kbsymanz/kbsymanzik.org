<p>Kurt and I recently attended a marriage conference hosted by our mission organization with the "Love and Respect" video series of talks by Emerson and Sarah Eggerich.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2343.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The room full of couples at the Love and Respect conference.</em><br /><em>The counselor with our mission organization moderated the event.</em><br /><em>Kurt and I are in the front left hand side of this picture!</em></p><p>If you ever have a chance to attend one of their conferences or see the <span class="caps">DVD</span> series, I strongly recommend it.  Kurt and I both really enjoyed the series.</p><p>excerpt from an article by Emerson Eggerich from their website<br />http://loveandrespect.com/blog/not-wrong-just-different/</p><p>"Not Wrong - Just Different!</p><p>....Friends, a wife needs to feel loved for who she is. A husband needs to feel respected for who he is.</p><p>A husband has two choices. He can either condemn his wife for her pink lenses, or he can appreciate God's design of her pink outlook. And, I might add, if he seeks to see through her pink lenses, she tends to engage him on his blue perspective. If he is sensitive to her need for love, he can appeal to her to soften her disrespectful reactions.</p><p>A wife can either judge her husband's blue lenses as stupid, or thank God for His design of this man. Too, if she seeks to see through his blue lenses, he tends to respond to her pink perspective. If she is aware of his maleness, she can appeal to him to be tenderer in his reactions.</p><p>Who is right and who is wrong? A husband is right when needing to feel respected. He is wrong when reacting in unloving ways.</p><p>A wife is right when needing to feel loved. She is wrong when reacting in disrespectful ways.</p><p>A beautiful discovery a couple can make is this: my spouse is not wrong, just different. Pink is not wrong for being pink. She is simply different from blue. Blue is not wrong for being blue. He is simply different from pink." </p>
