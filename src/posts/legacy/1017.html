<p>We really enjoy a wide variety of fresh produce from the market here.  A favourite meal is stirfry vegtables and rice.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3324.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p>We almost always have fruit to snack on - apples, bananas, mangos, oranges, pomelo, rambutan, lansones, etc...<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3325.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p>And of course our 'friends' the ants make serving food interesting.  If you come over, you'll often find the non-hot dishes in a serving dish sitting in water to keep the little critters from nibbling on our food!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3326.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p>
