<p>Down the street from us is a gate that leads into a cemetery.  Cemeterys here are like parks in the <span class="caps">USA</span> - people exercise there, have picnics, bury their loved ones, hold family reunions, sleep overnight at the grave site on special holidays, etc...</p><p>I enjoy morning walks there.  First view is of the mountains (Mount Apo and a few others.)  It is a visual reminder to me of my Saviour's love and care for me....even if there are clouds blocking a clear view of the mountain, He is always there - in every storm of life.  The visual reminder is His loving grace to me.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2890.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><em>I lift up my eyes to the</em> <br /><em>hills.
