<p>Today marks our 5th anniversary of being here in the Philippines.<br />In some ways it seems we've just landed - the cultural learning never ends!  But mostly it seems like we've been here a life time.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/18.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>A few days after we first arrived here</em></p><p>We have traveled many hard, dark roads yet we have traveled closer to our Father's heart.<br />We see His provision and grace.<br />We are stronger in our faith and love<br />and yet<br />in many ways, more shattered</p><p>and isn't that paradox the paradox of Christ?<br />He, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Creator of all<br />came humbly to earth a lowly baby, a servant King<br /><em>"For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its</em><br /><em>shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."</em> <br />(Hebrews 12:2)</p><p>He is our Prince of Peace, our Wonderful Counselor</p><p>I love the chorus of Michael Card's Song<br /><em>"There is a joy in the journey,</em><br /><em>there's a light we can love on the way.</em><br /><em>There is a wonder and wildness to life,</em><br /><em>and freedom for those who obey."</em></p><p>We have this gospel ministry in jars of clay to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.  We are afflicted in every way but not crushed; perplexed but not driven to despair.<br />(2 Cor. 4:7-8)</p><p>Our calling here has been one of joy and struggles ever drawing each of us closer to our ABBA's heart.  He upholds all and leads us on in His way.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2142.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p>Pray for us as we continue our journey here.  Because of the adoption process we will not be furloughing until June of 2013.  We will have been here seven years by then with only one short 8-week 'vacation' furlough.  <br />To be honest, a few of us are more than ready for a break of even just a few weeks to visit our home land and relatives.</p><p>though......</p><p>We are thankful to be here.   Thankful to be used by God for the advancement of His Kingdom; for the spread of His Gospel.</p><p>Thank you to each of you who  pray and financially support us.</p><p>There is a joy in the journey.</p>
