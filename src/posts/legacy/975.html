<p>I'd written a song for our wedding and part of it said,</p><p><em>through all the changes that are bound to come our way</em><br /><em>I vow my love to you</em><br /><em>With Jesus as my standard, strong in <span class="caps">HIM</span> I'll stay</em><br /><em>a gentle, quiet spirit, for <span class="caps">HIM</span> to create in my, I pray</em><br /><em>honoring <span class="caps">HIM</span> and you in love</em></p><p><em>and today, I marry my best friend</em><br /><em>man and wife, beginning without end</em><br /><em>a three strand chord will not be broken</em><br /><em>as we stand faithful in Jesus Christ,</em><br /><em>My friend, I love you</em></p><p>Jesus has led our path through many ups and downs, challenges, trials, good times, adventures....<br />and I'm thankful for Kurt.<br />I'm thankful to our loving Father's love, mercy, and grace in our lives and marriage.</p>
