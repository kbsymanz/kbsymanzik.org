<p>Jerard is pretty much a new born child in a four-year old body.<br />He does not make noise or move.  Whatever position we put him in he stays in.  Here are some pictures from the past few days.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2943.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2944.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2945.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerard likes his head rubbed.  James likes to rub his brother's head.</em><br /><em>James often goes up to Jerard and says, "I love you, Jerard."</em></p>
