<p>Well,  it is hot (init) in this Philippine Summer....even the local people are saying this summer is hotter than normal!!!!!</p><p>Ben is playing T-ball and Kirsten is playing Baseball.  They both think it is okay but it's not their favourite sport.  The biggest factor in their dislike of the sport is the heat.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/168.jpg" title=""Kirsten hitting a ball"" alt=""Kirsten hitting a ball"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten hitting a ball</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/169.jpg" title=""Ben at third base"" alt=""Ben at third base"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben at third base</em></p><p>Ben prefers to build with his k'nex or make weapons out of tree branches!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/170.jpg" title=""Fighter Ben"" alt=""Fighter Ben"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Fighter Ben</em></p><p>Bear (our dog) is growing bigger.
