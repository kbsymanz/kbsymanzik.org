<p>One of the main supply lines of water to Davao was damaged during the recent typhoon due to debris and heavy lumber coming down the river and hitting the pipe.<br />A fixer-solution is being installed and should restore some water in a week, but the real solution will be installed within two months.<br />So, one of the blessings of living on a hill is we don't flood.<br />But a down side, like now, is that when the city water pressure is low we don't receive any water.<br />So, now, we are using buckets of water to wash our dishes and selves with.  And I am making arrangements to do laundry elsewhere for a while.</p>
