<p>We just found out this afternoon that Jerard's surgery has been put off by another day because the doctors were not satisfied with some of his electrolytes.  He is on a special IV to help get them into balance.  We are hoping that the surgery will take place on Wednesday.</p><p>In other developments, Jerard has acquired an amoeba infection so he is on medicine for that.  He is pretty uncomfortable right now.  It appears that he is bothered in his stomach or bowels.</p><p>We are on day 8 of this hospital stay so far.  We would really like to be getting out of the hospital toward the end of this week after a successful surgery.  That would be a prayer request.  Thanks to everyone who is praying for Jerard and us.  We are very grateful for you and how God is sustaining us by your prayers.</p>
