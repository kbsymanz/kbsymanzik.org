<p>We enjoy eating Mexican food sometimes- especially buritoes and tacos.....but it is hard to find tortillas here.  I used to order them from a person here but he seems to have gone out of business now.</p><p>So, now, we are making our own.  They are not hard to make, just time consuming.</p><p>Kirsten made them the other day for supper and they were great!</p><p><strong>Tortillas De Harina</strong><br />3 cups flour<br />3 T shortening or lard<br />1 t. baking powder<br />3/4 t. salt<br />1 pinch sugar<br />1 cup water (room temp.)</p><p>Mix flour, shortening, baking powder, salt, and sugar.<br />Gradually add water until crumbly dough forms.<br />Work with hands until dough holds together on a floured board, shape into a ball and knead until smooth.  Divide dough into 12 roughly equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and let them set for 15 minutes.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1127.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>After making the dough, divide into balls.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1128.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Use a rolling pin to flatten into 8 inch circles.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1129.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Cook on ungreased griddle on medium heat.</em><br /><em>When it starts to bubble, turn it over.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1130.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>When entire tortilla starts to inflate, take it off grill.</em><br /><em>They are delicious!</em></p><p>I should've taken a picture of us eating them all for supper!</p><p>Thanks, Kirsten!!!!</p>
