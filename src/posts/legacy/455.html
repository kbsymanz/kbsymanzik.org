<p>Ben has been wanting a bike of his own since he mastered bike riding this summer.  He saved up money that had been given to him and some of his own allowance to buy himself a bike this weekend. <br />Kurt and I took him out to a local, reputable bike shop Saturday morning. He is so excited to have  a bike of his own.  Most of Saturday was spent riding the bike on our street and in a local cemetary.</p><p>Ben says, "Thanks, Grandpa, for helping me get a bike!"</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1427.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1428.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><em>Matthew 7: 7"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will</em> <em>find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 8For everyone</em> <em>who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks,</em> <em>the door will be opened.</em></p> <em>9"Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?</em> <em>10Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? 11If you, then,</em> <em>though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,</em> <em>how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to</em> <em>those who ask him! 12So in everything, do to others what you</em> <em>would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the</em> <em>Prophets.</em>
