<p>This was the sight that greeted me Monday morning at 5:05 a.m.<br />What a beautiful sight to see early in the morning....reminding me that  "The <span class="caps">LORD</span> has done great things for us,       and we are filled with joy." Psalm 126:3</p><p>This sight was just the beginning of a blessed day in which we got to speak with our sending church family in Michigan through Skype.  (It was their Sunday evening service time at our 7:30a.m. Monday time!)<br />What a blessing to see faces and hear voices of friends we hold in our heart dearly.  We felt a mix of homesickness and joy as we spoke with our friends and shared about our life here.</p><p>" The <span class="caps">LORD</span> has done great things for us,       and we are filled with joy."</p>
