<p>We recently hired a young man, Eric, to work 20 hours a week mostly with Jerard, doing his physical therapy and assisting in his care.   <br /><img src="/images/legacy/2717.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2716.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />As Jerard grows, he becomes heavier and harder to hold especially when bathing, since he cannot help us by holding himself up. <br /><img src="/images/legacy/2723.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Eric helping us on the day we moved in to our new rental</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2724.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2725.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Eric is a wonderful care giver and really good with the boys.  James sometimes cries when Eric goes home at the end of his shift!</p>
