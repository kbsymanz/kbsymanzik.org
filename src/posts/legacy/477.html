<p>It has been 7 years since my Mom went home to Heaven following a 2 1/2 year battle with leukemia. </p><p>"When we asunder part,<br />It gives us inward pain;<br />But we shall still be joined in heart,<br />And hope to meet again."</p><p>I do wish she'd been around longer to see her grandchildren grow.  She would've been so pleased that we are on the mission field and adopting two boys.<br />But God in His providence has a reason for each event in our lives.<br />I'm thankful for the Mom God gave me.</p><p>"Blest be the tie that binds<br />Our hearts in Christian love;<br />The fellowship of kindred minds<br />Is like to that above."</p>
