<p><em>"Forgiveness is the key which unlocks the door of resentment</em> <em>and the handcuffs of hatred.</em>  </p><p><em>It breaks the chains of bitterness and the shackles of</em> <em>selfishness.</em>  </p><p><em>The forgiveness of Jesus not only takes away our sin,</em><br /><em>it makes them as if they had never been."</em> </p> Corrie Ten Boom from the book "Tramp for the Lord" 1974
