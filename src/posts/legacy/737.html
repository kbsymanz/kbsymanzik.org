<p>This past weekend I attended a women's retreat at a near by retreat center.  <br /><img src="/images/legacy/2348.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="268" /></p><p>The theme of the retreat was "<span class="caps">LIVING</span> <span class="caps">INTENTIONALLY</span>."</p><p>Elim Evangelical Free Church is a congregation of about 200 in Puyallup, Washington.  They sent over a team of 6 women to lead this retreat for us.  They are also doing another retreat for missionary women in Manila.  One of the missionary family's they support used to live here in Davao but are now up in Manila.</p><p>It was a wonderful time of laughing, playing fun games, having quiet time to pray and talk, make new friends/deepen existing friendships, etc.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2347.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="268" /><br /><em>making jewelery during free time</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2351.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="268" /><br /><em>playing "In it to Win it" and trying to stack 6 apples in under a</em><br /><em>minute.  We played several other games like this - the room</em><br /><em>was filled with laughter.  It was great fun!</em></p><p>For me, it was also a much needed break.  The theme verse was<br />Colossians 1:10</p><p><em>And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the</em> <br /><em>Lord and may please Him in every way: Bearing fruit in every</em><br /><em>good work, growing in the knowledge of God.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2350.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="268" /> <em>Praise and worship time</em></p><p>"Living Intentionally'  - "Living with my past", "Living with Boundaries",<br />and "Living with Brokenness" were the three primary sessions.  Good food for thought.</p><p>I am thankful these women were willing to work on planning this retreat, make the financial sacrifices needed to fly over here, bring us good messages, <span class="caps">USA</span> chocolates, chex mix, Starbucks coffee...but mostly I am thankful for the 6 new friends I have gained.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2349.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="268" /><br /><em>Thanks, Tomina, Gretchen, Nancy, Kim, Frances, and Cheryl.</em><br /><em>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust</em><br /><em>in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the</em> <em>Holy Spirit. Romans 15:13</em> </p>
