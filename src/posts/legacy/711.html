<p>My mom used to make stollen each year for the holiday.  I haven't made it in a long time, but this year, being a bit more homesick for family and friends in the <span class="caps">USA</span>, I decided to make it again.</p><p>I found a great recipe at allrecipes.com.  (Old Fashiioned Stollen) Below is my rendition of this recipe.  This recipe calls for three risings, but it is excellent and well worth the effort!  I put frosting on top, too!!!  YUM!!!!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2291.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="140" /><br />Ingredients</p>    * 1 1/2 cups milk (or 1 1/2 cups water and 6 T milk powder)    * 1/2 cup sugar    * 1 1/2 teaspoons salt    * 2 teaspoons lemon flavouring or pineapple flavouring    * 3/4 cup butter    * 1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast (or 1 T yeast)    * 1 teaspoon white sugar    * 1/4 cup warm water    * 2 eggs    * 2 egg yolks    * 5 2/3 cups all-purpose flour    * 1 cup raisins  I've been adding one cup candied fruit like my mom used to add, along with one cup of raisins.     I've been leaving out the nuts - they are expensive here)    * 1/2 cup chopped nuts    * 1 egg, beaten<p>Directions</p>   1. In a small saucepan, heat milk until hot, but not boiling; mix in 1/2 cup sugar, salt, lemon zest, and butter. Remove from heat, and cool slightly. In a small bowl, mix together yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, and 1/4 cup water; stir into milk. Beat in 2 eggs and egg yolks. Mix in 3 cups flour. Cover, and let rise in a warm place.   2. Mix in the raisins and nuts. Gradually mix in enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough. Place dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover, and set aside to rise.   3. Divide dough into 3 balls. Roll each ball out into a thick log, braid, and tuck the ends under. Place on a large cookie sheet, and set aside to rise one more time.   4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush beaten egg over the dough. It gives a shine to it.   5. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.
