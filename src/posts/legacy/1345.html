<p>Mikayla has been tutoring several Koreans in English.  Two brothers were coming quite frequently each week (2 - 5x) for tutoring in order to pass the English exam for Faith International Academy.  After almost a year of working with Mikayla, they passed!  Great job guys!  Great job Mikayla!!!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/4310.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>Mikayla with her tutorees and James.
