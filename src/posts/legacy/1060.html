<p>It is not unusual to see an occasional mouse or cockroach in the grocery store while shopping (depending which store you shop at).<br />I figure the one that walked by my foot today slowly and unsteadily must be dying slowly from mouse poison!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3420.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="225" /><br />I just kicked him out of the way!</p><p>Amazing, really, seven years ago I was terrified of roaches, rats and mice....today i pretty much view them as an annoyance but normal part of life here in the Philippines!</p><p>But word to the wise....wash the can lids prior to opening your canned goods!!!!</p>
