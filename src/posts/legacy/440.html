<p>I really was blessed to read this by John Piper.......</p><p>"I was born into a believing family through no merit of my own at all. I was given a mind to think and a heart to feel through no merit of my own at all. I was brought into the hearing of the gospel through no merit of my own at all. My rebellion was subdued, my hardness removed, my blindness overcome, and my deadness awakened through no merit of my own at all.</p>    Thus I became a believer in Christ through no merit of my own at all. And so I am an heir of God with Christ through no merit of my own at all. Now when I put forward effort to please the Lord who bought me, this is to me no merit at all, because          ...it is not I, but the grace of God that is with me. (1 Cor. 15:10)          ...God is working in me that which is pleasing in his sight. (Heb. 13:21)          ...he fulfills every resolve for good by his power. (2 Thess. 1:11)    And therefore there is no ground for boasting in myself, but only in God's mighty grace. Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord. (1 Cor. 1:31)"<p>Oh, How He loves us!</p>
