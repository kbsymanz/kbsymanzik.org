<p>Hi,</p><p>Thank you for praying for me.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1855.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Please keep it up.<br />I haven't had any seizures since yesterday around noon.</p><p>I'm in a room with all kinds of tubes and wires and beeps and people coming in and out.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1858.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p>Today my eyes were open more.  My Mom said they were giving me blood.  I really don't like the IV needle in my foot.  I kept trying to kick at it but my Mom or someone put a blanket in the way so I couldn't.</p><p>I started lifting my right arm today and playing a little bit with my alphabet wheel.  I like to spin it and hear it sing.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1857.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>I cough a lot but it's phlegm.  I don't eat on my own.  My left side doesn't like to move much.  Someone stuck a tube down my nose into my stomach to feed me Isomil.  I can't wait til that comes out.<br />I was trying to pull that out too but the nurse tied a cloth to my arm and to the bed so I couldn't reach up to pull it out.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1856.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Keep me in your prayers, please.  The doctors are happy to see me more awake today but I don't feel like moving much.  Pray I don't have anymore seizures and that the medicines they want to give me orally will help me not have any.</p><p>I guess I'll be in the hospital a few more days.  They want me to eat on my own but I have no desire even to suck on a sippy cup right now.  I'm just really, really tired!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1859.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Thanks!</p>
