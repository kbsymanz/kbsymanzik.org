<p>Mikayla has really been enjoying playing clarinet and learning trombone.</p><p>Yesterday, the Middle School band had a concert for parents during the day before the band director and his wife go on furlough in a week.  </p><p>The band director and his wife are fabulous musicians.  Mr. Becker has done a great job teaching music and developing the band program here.  He and his wife, Jessica, add so much.  Jessica teaches music and Bible at the High School.<br />They are expecting their first baby in a few months.  Pray for safe delivery for the baby.  Then the three of them will be back in August!</p><p>Mikayla and Jeen played a duet.  The whole band sounded great!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/580.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/581.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
