Ben loves that castle.  He's been sleeping in it at night!  Sir Knight Ben!!!!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/325.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Knight Ben</em></p><p>Because most of his buddies had been on furlough for the summer we also celebrated his 6th birthday with a beach bash yesterday.  His buddies were back from furlough.  The weather was great.  They all played in the water.  We had brownies and ice cream.  Ben flew a kite.  He had a good time, though he will tell you he's 7 since he had two parties!!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/322.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>At the beach with friends</em></p>
