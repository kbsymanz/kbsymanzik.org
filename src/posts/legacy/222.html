<p>As I write this, Beth and Jerard are at the hospital checking in for the fifth hospital stay.  Jerard's fifth surgery is scheduled for tomorrow at 1pm to install a second shunt (actually the third, but the first had to be removed at the last hospital stay due to infection).</p><p>Please pray for the effectiveness of this new shunt.  We are praying that this will be the final surgery and hospitaliztion for a long time and that the shunt will work as it is supposed to.  Please also pray that Jerard may remain infection free and that the hospitalization will be relatively short.  The doctor thought that we might be out by Saturday or Sunday as long as there were no complications.</p>
