<p>This hymn has been playing through my mind recently as I read and study the book of Romans.  Thought I'd share the words with you all!</p><p>The words were written by Charles Wesley.</p><p>"And can it be that I should gain<br />An interest in the Savior's blood?<br />Died He for me, who caused His pain--<br />For me, who Him to death pursued?<br />Amazing love! How can it be,<br />That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?<br />Amazing love! How can it be,<br />That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?</p><p>'Tis mystery all: th'Immortal dies:<br />Who can explore His strange design?<br />In vain the firstborn seraph tries<br />To sound the depths of love divine.<br />'Tis mercy all! Let earth adore,<br />Let angel minds inquire no more.<br />'Tis mercy all! Let earth adore;<br />Let angel minds inquire no more.</p><p>He left His Father's throne above<br />So free, so infinite His grace--<br />Emptied Himself of all but love,<br />And bled for Adam's helpless race:<br />'Tis mercy all, immense and free,<br />For O my God, it found out me!<br />'Tis mercy all, immense and free,<br />For O my God, it found out me!</p><p>Long my imprisoned spirit lay,<br />Fast bound in sin and nature's night;<br />Thine eye diffused a quickening ray--<br />I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;<br />My chains fell off, my heart was free,<br />I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.<br />My chains fell off, my heart was free,<br />I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.</p><p>Still the small inward voice I hear,<br />That whispers all my sins forgiven;<br />Still the atoning blood is near,<br />That quenched the wrath of hostile Heaven.<br />I feel the life His wounds impart;<br />I feel the Savior in my heart.<br />I feel the life His wounds impart;<br />I feel the Savior in my heart.</p><p>No condemnation now I dread;<br />Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;<br />Alive in Him, my living Head,<br />And clothed in righteousness divine,<br />Bold I approach th'eternal throne,<br />And claim the crown, through Christ my own.<br />Bold I approach th'eternal throne,<br />And claim the crown, through Christ my own." </p>
