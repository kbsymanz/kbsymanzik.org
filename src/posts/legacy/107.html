 Our Children, Mikayla, Kirsten, and Benjamin started school today at Faith Academy Davao for the 2007-2008 school year.  <p>Mikayla is in 7th grade.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/327.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla and Bear</em></p><p>Kirsten is in 4th grade.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/328.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten and Taters</em></p><p>Benjamin started Kindergarten today.  He was so excited to be going to school for the first time.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/329.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /><br /><em>A tired 'Sir Knight Ben'</em></p><p>Please continue to uphold them before the Father's throne in prayer as they continue to deal with cross-cultural adjustments, missing friends and relatives back in the States, and dealing with the every day issues of growing up.</p><p>Pray also for Mikayla and Kirsten to get completely over the fungal and bacterial infections they have had in their ears.  Mikayla is now on her third round of antibiotics and ear drops.  Kirsten's infection is finally showing signs of clearing up so she is just  on ear drops now.  They both came down with ear infections over a month ago.  The doctor said it was most likely from swimming in dirty water.</p><p>We thank God for our children and for how well, overall, they have done with the move overseas.</p>
