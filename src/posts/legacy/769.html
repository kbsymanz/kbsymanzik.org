<p><em>Daniel 4: 3How great are his signs,  how mighty his wonders!</em><br /><em>His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,    and his dominion endures</em> <em>from generation to generation.</em></p><p>The high school hosted their annual spring banquet recently.  <br /><img src="/images/legacy/2471.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>I must say, my daughter is very gorgeous!!!!  (Proud momma</em> <em>talking!!) And grateful her beauty is growing also in "the hidden</em> <em>person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle</em><br /><em>and quiet spirit,which in God's sight is very precious."</em> <br /><img src="/images/legacy/2470.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="533" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2472.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2473.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p><p>Thankful too for a high school that puts on God-Centered banquets that stress character and group fun over pairing off and dating.</p>
