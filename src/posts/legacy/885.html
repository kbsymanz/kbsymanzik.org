<p>A good friend, Bebe, asked me to share at a Bible Study she holds on Sunday afternoons for a group of women who are new Christians in a poor area near her house.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2856.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>We were not in this community yesterday, but one like it.</em><br /><em>Our camara is not working so I was unable to get pictures</em><br /><em>from yesterday.</em></p><p>Mikayla and I went yesterday to do that and came back far more blessed than we gave.  We both feel like the sense of community, family and friend relationship closeness, the joy, the honesty experienced there is what the church family is intended to be.  These women, not rich materially, are rich in the blessings of God - trust, joy....<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2855.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2854.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />as long as there is rice in the home there is enough.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/953.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2858.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2857.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Isn't God calling each of us to that?  As long as our eyes are on Him, trusting Him, it is enough.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2850.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />I shared with the ladies how much God loves each of us. I based the devotional of Psalm 139: 1 - 18 and Romans 8: 35 - 39</p><p><em>1 You have searched me, <span class="caps">LORD</span>,</em>   <em>and you know me.</em><br /><em>2 You know when I sit and when I rise;</em>   <em>you perceive my thoughts from afar.</em><br /><em>3 You discern my going out and my lying down;</em>   <em>you are familiar with all my ways.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2853.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2852.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>4 Before a word is on my tongue</em>   <em>you, <span class="caps">LORD</span>, know it completely.</em><br /><em>5 You hem me in behind and before,</em>   <em>and you lay your hand upon me.</em><br /><em>6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,</em>   <em>too lofty for me to attain.</em></p> <em>7 Where can I go from your Spirit?</em>   <em>Where can I flee from your presence?</em><p><img src="/images/legacy/2848.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>8 If I go up to the heavens, you are there;</em>   <em>if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.</em><br /><em>9 If I rise on the wings of the dawn,</em>   <em>if I settle on the far side of the sea,</em><br /><em>10 even there your hand will guide me,</em>   <em>your right hand will hold me fast.</em><br /><em>11 If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me</em>   <em>and the light become night around me,"</em><br /><em>12 even the darkness will not be dark to you;</em>   <em>the night will shine like the day,</em>   <em>for darkness is as light to you.</em></p> <em>13 For you created my inmost being;</em>   <em>you knit me together in my mother's womb.</em><p><img src="/images/legacy/2851.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>14 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;</em>   <em>your works are wonderful,</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2846.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />   <em>I know that full well.</em><br /><em>15 My frame was not hidden from you</em>   <em>when I was made in the secret place,</em>   <em>when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.</em><br /><em>16 Your eyes saw my unformed body;</em>   <em>all the days ordained for me were written in your book</em>   <em>before one of them came to be.</em><br /><em>17 How precious to me are your thoughts,God!</em>   <em>How vast is the sum of them!</em><br /><em>18 Were I to count them,</em>   <em>they would outnumber the grains of sand--</em>   <em>when I awake, I am still with you.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2849.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2847.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><em>Romans 8</em><br /><em>35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble</em> <em>or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger</em><br /><em>or sword? 36 As it is written:</em></p>   <em>"For your sake we face death all day long;</em>   <em>we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered."</em> <em>37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors</em><em>through him who loved us. 38 For I am convinced that neither</em> <em>death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present</em> <em>nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth,</em> <em>nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us</em> <em>from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</em> <p><img src="/images/legacy/958.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/955.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/952.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
