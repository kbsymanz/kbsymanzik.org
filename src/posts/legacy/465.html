<p>Our Filipino friends have taught me so much about rejoicing in trials and being content with what we have.</p><p>As you know, a typhoon went through Manila on Saturday.  It was the worst rains they've had in 40 years.  There has been much flooding, loss of possessions, home, life.</p><p>Today, the administrator from Faith Manila campus sent an update on how they all are fairing up there.  He included this quote from a Filipino colleague when asked by her supervisor how she was doing.</p><blockquote><p>"We are fine sir. Our appliances are floating around the house downstairs. I went to my sisters place and it was the same. <strong>The good thing is, there are plenty of fish to catch!</strong>"</p></blockquote><p>This demonstrates the tremendous Filipino spirit which I admire so much.</p>
