<p>Jerard just came back to the room after surgery and the recovery room 30 minutes ago. Surgery went well and as planned.  The cerebral fluid was not clear (it appeared to have blood in it) but we won't find out what that means until a culture is completed within a couple days.  It might just be that there was some slight bleeding when the brain had shifted due to different fluid pressures.  The doctor explained that that happens sometimes and he didn't seem to concerned about it.  If the culture shows an infection, then that is the much greater issue.  We will see in a couple days.</p><p>As of right now, Jerard is awake, attentive and hungry.  The doctor has not cleared him to drink milk yet but hopefully soon.</p><p>Thank you for your prayers.  We are pleased with how the surgery went.  Now we will wait to see if the brain shifts into the proper position over the next couple days.</p>
