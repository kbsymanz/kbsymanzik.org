<p>In  October I had blogged about Flora Mae and Rico.  To read more of their story go to http://reachinternationalhealthcareandtraining.com/content/mae-and-rico<br />But I wanted to give this update to you on Flora Mae's surgeries!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2422.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br />Mae, our neighbor's foster child, has a walker now!  She has had two surgeries to fix her leg that has been broken since she was 5 years old. She's doing extremely well since her surgery last week! She has an external fixator (since the first surgery last Dec), but is finally able to start learning to walk again. Doc's say maybe it can be removed in a couple of months. What a day that will be for this child who has been crippled since she was 5 yrs old!!</p><p>It is so cool how God works.  That walker Mae is using had been given to her a few weeks ago by the landlord of the house Dr. Sam and Sherri rent!  At the time it was given to Mae it didn't look like she'd be able to use it for a long time.  But this past surgery found her leg healing up better than the doctors predicted, which has allowed for Mae to start practicing walking now!!!!</p><p><em>"Lord of all to Thee we raise, this our hymn of grateful praise..."</em></p>
