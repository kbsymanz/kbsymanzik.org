<p>Our school, being an international school, has various holidays it observes, some Korean, some Filipino, some American, etc.<br />Students will be off on September 8th to celebrate Chuseok - the Korean Thanksgiving.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3886.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="248" /> <br />Chuseok (추석) is one of the biggest and most important holidays in Korea. Family members from near and far come together to share food and stories and to give thanks to their ancestors for an abundant harvest. In 2014, Chuseok Day falls on September 8, but the holiday is observed for a total of three days (September 7-9). Fortunately, this year's Chuseok holiday period makes for a 5-day weekend since Wednesday, September 10 was also designated a day off during this national holiday period. Many Koreans will visit their family homes to spend quality time together, and the holidays provide a good opportunity to enjoy traditional cultural experiences throughout Korea.

I think we may try to make some or at least purchase some pre-made!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3887.jpg" alt="" width="341" height="212" /> </p>
