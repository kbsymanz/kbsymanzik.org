<p>Well, it's been quite a year for us.</p><p>We thank God for all His provisions, the lessons He has taught us, the opportunity to be full-time on the mission field.....</p><p>Thank you to each of you who support us in prayer and financially.  We appreciate it more than words can say.</p><p>Our prayer is that we will continually seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness, that we will continue to grow in His wisdom and grace, and that the fruit of the Spirit will be evident in each of our lives.</p><p>Happy New Year!</p>
