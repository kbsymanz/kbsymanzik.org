<p>We had a court hearing for James' adoption November 28th.  Thankfully, it was our last court hearing for James' adoption.  Now we just have to wait for the judge's decision.  That could take 30 - 60 days and prayerfully, not longer.</p><p>Today, being Thanksgiving in the <span class="caps">USA</span>, I celebrated with Mikayla, her friend, Sarah, my sister, Meredy, my brother-in-law Ron, and my father-in-law, Gene.  We had plenty of food and fun.</p><p>We started our Thanksgiving celebration by singing a favourite hymn of mine....Now Thank We All Our God</p><p><em>Now thank we all our God, with heart and hands and voices,</em><br /><em>Who wondrous things has done, in Whom this world rejoices;</em><br /><em>Who from our mothers' arms has blessed us on our way</em><br /><em>With countless gifts of love, and still is ours today.</em></p><p><em>O may this bounteous God through all our life be near us,</em><br /><em>With ever joyful hearts and bless√®d peace to cheer us;</em><br /><em>And keep us in His grace, and guide us when perplexed;</em><br /><em>And free us from all ills, in this world and the next!</em></p><p><em>All praise and thanks to God the Father now be given;</em><br /><em>The Son and Him Who reigns with Them in highest Heaven;</em><br /><em>The one eternal God, whom earth and Heaven adore;</em><br /><em>For thus it was, is now, and shall be evermore.</em></p>
