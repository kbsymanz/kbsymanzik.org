<p>funny how things tend to go "in spurts" or "in groups" - <br />the camera batteries no longer hold a charge; the ones we bought here in the Philippines to replace them don't really work; the hard drive on a main computer in our house fails; appliances break....</p><p>paperwork collected for adoption according to the list given "isn't enough".  Tomorrow Kurt and I fly to Manila to get a notarized affidavit of adoption eligibility from the US Embassy.  Another hurdle to jump....another hoop to go through......</p><p>trials of various shapes and sizes hit us - some minor, some major, some on-going and the pressure from them can build up to breaking point.....</p><p>and sometimes, my humanness says "why?  why can't it just be easy for a moment or two?"</p><p>then i read the refreshing word in Romans 5 and know my <span class="caps">ABBA</span> is growing me and us into His likeness.  He is there each step of the way.  And in that I can rest.</p><p><em>Therefore, since we have been justified by faith,</em><br /><em>we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</em><br /><em>2 Through him we have also obtained access by faith</em><br /><em>into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the</em><br /><em>glory of God. 3 Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings,</em><br /><em>knowing that suffering produces endurance, 4 and endurance</em><br /><em>produces character, and character produces hope,</em><br /><em>5 and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love</em><br /><em>has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit</em><br /><em>who has been given to us.</em> </p>
