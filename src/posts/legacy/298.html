This is one of the brands of milk we purchase here.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/866.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="224" /><br /><em>Boxed milk</em></p><p>Mongo beans are sort of like split peas in the US.  They are really good fried!  They are also good in stews and soups.<br />Fish sauce is used for flavoring in various food dishes.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/867.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>'Patis' (Fish Sauce), and mongo beans</em></p>
