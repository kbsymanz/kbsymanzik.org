<p>Tomorrow (Thursday June 30) we move to our new rental house.<br />It is still close to school and saves us a bit of money each month in rent. <br />We signed up for internet at the new rental but it will take about 10 days or so to come up, so I'm not sure how often I'll be posting in the next couple weeks.<br />We've been busy packing, having a painter friend paint the house, fixing up the house a bit, cleaning...<br />Tomorrow morning a jeepney will help us take our stuff to the new house.  We have 3 or 4 guys helping too!  It should go well.<br />Keep us in your prayers; for the move, for our financial support to increase.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2503.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>our new rental home</em></p>
