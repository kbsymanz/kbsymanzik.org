<p>A kitty was out on the street meowing a sad cry one night last week.  Mikayla and I watched the kitty for about 15 minutes, debating if we should rescue the kitty but then the momma cat came and got her kitty.<br />But a day or two later the kitty was once again in the street in front of our house meowing a pitiful cry.  The Momma cat never appeared.  <br />So we brought the kitty up on to our veranda, washed out her eyes, fed her...and now, have adopted her.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/223.jpg" title=""Mikayla with her answer to prayer"" alt=""Mikayla with her answer to prayer"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>Mikayla with her answer to prayer!</em></p><p>The kids are so delighted with her.  Her name is "Taters".  </p><p>I had suggested "ATP" or "TAP" ("Answer To Prayer" or "The Answered Prayer") because Mikayla especially had been praying for a cat.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/228.jpg" title=""Taters"" alt=""Taters"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>Taters!</em></p><p>One of the hardest things for our kids to do in preparation for moving overseas was giving up their cats.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/230.jpg" title=""Taters"" alt=""Taters"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>Taters!</em></p><p>God heard their prayers and provided a cute little kitty to nurture, feed, and love.   </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/222.jpg" title=""Kirsten with Taters"" alt=""Kirsten with Taters"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>Kirsten with Taters!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/221.jpg" title=""Ben with  Taters"" alt=""Ben with  Taters"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>Ben with Taters!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/226.jpg" title=""Mikayla with Taters"" alt=""Mikayla with Taters"" width="300" height="225" /> <em>Mikayla with Taters!</em></p><p>Taters really likes rice and tuna!
