<p>A couple weeks ago our web hosting server had some major problem and we were off line until today!<br />That we are back on line today is a blessing as we'd been told all our blog history was lost!  </p><p>A prayer I've been working on memorizing is this:<br /><em>Teach me to treat all that comes my way with peace of soul</em><br /><em>and with firm conviction that Your will governs all.</em><br /><em>In unforeseen events let me not forget that all are sent by You.</em><br />Elisabeth Elliott quotes this Orthodox prayer in her book "A Path Through Suffering."  So I am sure there has been a reason for this downtime we've had.</p><p>This few weeks without being able to blog has been a bit frustrating for me as I really enjoy blogging and keeping family and friends updated through this blog site!  I am very thankful our website has come back on line and we have not lost the past four years of blogs.</p><p>....now to do a back up of all these blogs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Watch for more posts soon!  Just wanted to let you know we are thankful to be back on line with our website!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
