<p>As I blog right now, James is on the sala floor crying out for "Daddy, Kirsten, Ben" over and over.  The three of them just left to go to various Saturday morning activities.</p><p>As I listen to James cry out for his Daddy I find myself wondering how fervently do I cry out for my Heavenly Father?  How fervently do I seek Him?  Do I cry and yearn for Him as my two-year old son cries and yearns for his earthly Daddy?</p><p>James and Jerard are such blessings to me.  God has used these two to draw me closer to Him, to understand a bit more about the deep, deep love He has for me, His mercy and grace  -  despite the messes I make.</p><p>May we each cry out to God and see Him First all the days of our lives.</p><p>Psalm 57: 1-3</p> 1 Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me,   for in you my soul takes refuge;<p>in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge,   till the storms of destruction pass by.</p><p><em>2I cry out to God Most High,</em>   <em>to God who fulfills his purpose for me.</em></p><p>3 He will send from heaven and save me;   he will put to shame him who tramples on me.                         Selah</p><p>God will send out  his steadfast love and his faithfulness!</p><p>Matthew 6:33<br /><em>33But seek first the kingdom of God and his</em> <br /><em>righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</em></p>
