<p>Today Jerard rolled from his front to his back and then from his back to his front.  He also said 'mama'!  <br />We love these encouraging signs of growth and development we see in him.  <br />We thank God for blessing us with Jerard and with James!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/983.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Jerard looking very happy!.</em></p><p>James has been developing in the area of compassion toward his brother.  When Jerard is crying or fussy James will hand Jerard a toy or a bottle.  It is very neat to see that character develop in him.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/985.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>James pointing to the flashing lights on the shirt Jerard is wearing!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/984.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Another milestone!  Jerard usually placidly lets toys be taken from his hand, but this morning he did not want James taking the toy he had! (perhaps this counts as their first 'fight!')</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/986.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>All three boys spend a lot of time playing together.  Ben is a great 'kuya' (older brother) to James and Jerard.  James likes to run after Ben and also have Ben chase him!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/987.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <br /><em>Ben is very compassionate towards Jerard.  The other day Ben said, "It makes me sad Jerard can't see."  Ben is good about giving him toys, talking to him.  It's a blessing to see!</em></p>
