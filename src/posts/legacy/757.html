<p>The drainage system here is not the most efficient so when there is a heavy rain fall, the streets flood very easily.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2420.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /><br />Last night, Kurt, Kirsten and I were driving near a local mall during a very heavy downpour.  As we slowly drove through the rain-flooded streets, the water was about 1 1/2 - 2 feet up the side of our car.  Thankfully it didn't get into the car engine!  We didn't stall!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2421.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /><br />The streets here flood easily.  We are thankful our house is on top of a hill!!!</p>
