<p>Mikayla is 16 years old today!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2113.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p>Yesterday, we had a merienda for her and her classmates after school - complete with some of her favourite treats: brownies, chocolate chip cookies, cinnamon rolls.  We also had kalamansi pie which is sortof like lemon pie.  It is lami kaayo (very delicious).  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2178.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2176.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla and classmates enjoying food and chat time.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2177.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla and Kirsten goofing around!</em></p><p>Today, Kirsten, Ben and I took Mikayla to a favourite mall of hers for lunch and a bit of time to shop.</p><p>Tonight, we had her "tea partner" and her "coffee partner" over for dinner!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2182.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2179.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Instead of cake, we had a pizza pan size chocolate chip</em><br /><em>cookie frosted and decorated and lite up with 'trick candles'</em><br /><em>for Mikayla to blow out!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2180.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Trying to get the candles to stay out!  I found candles that</em><br /><em>relight and put them on Mikayla's cookie in honor of one of</em><br /><em>her aunts in the states who always used trick candles on her</em><br /><em>own sons' birthday cakes.  Mikayla has always enjoyed those!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2181.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>A birthday hug from Mom.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2130.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><br /><em>Kurt is gone on a business trip for a week.

And we pray that Mikayla, being rooted and established in love,  may have power, together with all the Lord's holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge.  We pray that she continues to always seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness all her days.  And that she continue to grow into the woman that He wants her to be.</p><p>She is a blessing and we are pleased with the fruit of the Spirit we see growing in her life.<br />We thank God for her!</p>
