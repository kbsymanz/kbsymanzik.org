<p>Mikayla has been playing basketball on the High School Girls team.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1686.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Recently she'd been experiencing some heart racing and skipping beats while exercising.  Tuesday she came home from practice a bit scared due to her symptoms.</p><p>I took her to the doctor on Wednesday.  He ordered a stress echo test.  That was done yesterday.  Today we picked up the results and discussed them with the doctor.</p><p>The results show she has Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome which is basically an extra electrical pathway in the heart that can cause fluttering and racing of the heart especially during exercise.  It is not life-threatening and she can still play basketball, soccer, run, etc.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1687.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Keep her in your prayers.  Next week the basketball team travels up to Baguio for an International Schools sports competition.  She will be gone for 5 days.</p><p>I told her that when I was in my 20s I was diagnosed with the same thing.  It seems as I've gotten older the occurrence of symptoms has lessened.  She seemed relieved to know her Mom had been given that same diagnosis and was still alive to tell her about it!</p><p>Thanks for praying for Mikayla - for healing, for peace.</p><p>Want to read more about WPW?
