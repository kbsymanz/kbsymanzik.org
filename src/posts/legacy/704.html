<p>A few weeks ago, Ben asked his teacher if he could bring Jerard in to the class to 'show off' his brother!  So today, I took Jerard to Ben's class.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2263.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2264.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Ben shared a bit about how we got James and Jerard and about some of Jerard's special needs.  We had a handout on hydrocephalus, brain function and what a shunt is.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2265.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2266.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><em>(And personally, as Ben's Mom, I was so happy and proud of</em><br /><em>him for taking the initiative to want to show Jerard to his class.</em>  <em>Ben is a good kuya [older brother] to Jerard and James!)</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2208.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
