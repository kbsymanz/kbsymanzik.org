<p>My husband just read this to me this morning from a book he is reading.  I really like this prayer.</p><p><em>"May God bless you with discomfort at easy answers, half-truths,</em><br /><em>and superficial relationships so that you may live deep within</em><br /><em>your heart.</em></p><p><em>May God bless you with anger at injustice, oppression,</em><br /><em>and explotation of people so that you may work for justice,</em><br /><em>freedom, and peace.</em></p><p><em>May God bless you with tears to shed for those who suffer pain,</em><br /><em>rejection, hunger and war, so that you may reach out your hand</em><br /><em>to comfort them and to turn their pain into joy.</em></p><p><em>And may God bless you with enough foolishness to believe</em><br /><em>that you can make a difference in the world, so that you can do</em><br /><em>what others claim cannot be done to bring justice and kindness</em><br /><em>to all our children and the poor.  Amen.</em></p><p>Pg 105 "Prayer - Does It Make Any Difference?" by Philip Yancey</p>
