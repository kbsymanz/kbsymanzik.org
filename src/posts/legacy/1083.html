<p><img src="/images/legacy/3461.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="246" /></p><p>One of my favourite and well-worn cookbooks is "The Plain and Fancy Cookbook" put out by our mission organization.</p><p>I had burned mine absentmindedly when I left it on a lit burner while reading a recipe shortly after Jerard died.  </p><p>I am thankful now the book is available as a <span class="caps">PDF</span> and in e-reader form.<br />Download it for yourselves!  It is free to be shared!  It's got great recipes!!!!!</p> http://plain-and-fancy.weebly.com<p><img src="/images/legacy/3299.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>what my hard copy looks like after trying to cook it!</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3298.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>what my hard copy looks like after trying to cook it!</em></p>
