<p>Hi, I'm back in Davao now.  So thankful for safe travels, thankful for time with family and friends in the <span class="caps">USA</span>, thankful to be here with my husband and three children.<br />My brain feels foggy as I work on resetting my body clock thirteen hours ahead of where it had been when I took off from the <span class="caps">USA</span> on December 3rd.</p><p>"Jet lag can occur any time you travel quickly across two or more time zones. The more time zones you cross, the more likely you are to be sleepy and sluggish -- and the longer and more intense the symptoms are likely to be.That's because it can take up to a day for each time zone crossed for your body to adjust to the local time."</p><p>(http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/excessive-sleepiness-10/jet-lag-remedies)</p><p>I'll blog more when my brain feels less foggy but for now I'll share some pictures with you!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3660.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3661.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3662.jpg" alt="" width="187" height="246" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3663.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3664.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3665.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3659.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p>
