<p>Jerard had his stitches out today.  <br />The soft spot on his head is bulging and hard - <br />pressure build up - <br />one shunt not enough.  The doctor wants to get a 2nd shunt in soon......so probably next week we will be back in the hospital to put in a second shunt.<br />Tomorrow he has an ultrasound, a cerebral fluid tap, and blood work for the immunoassay work up.  The doctor wants to make sure the cerebral fluid is clear of infection prior to installing another shunt.<br />Keep us in your prayers.</p>
