<p>A Bible Dedication happened today.<br />For a language group I can not freely talk about.<br />Just know that after years and years of work by translators and language assistants, a large group of people here on Mindanao have been blessed with the Bible in their language.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3892.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p>What a blessing to be with other believers from every tribe and tongue.</p><p><em>Revelation 7:9 - 17</em><br /><em>After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude</em><br /><em>that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes</em><br /><em>and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3893.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p><em>before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches</em><br /><em>in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice,</em><br /><em>"Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne,</em><br /><em>and to the Lamb!"</em><br /><em>Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, "Who are these,</em> <em>clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?"</em><br /><em>I said to him, "Sir, you know." And he said to me, "These are</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3894.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p><em>the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed</em> <em>their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</em></p><p><em>"Therefore they are before the throne of God,</em>    <em>and serve him day and night in his temple;</em>    <em>and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his</em> <em>presence.</em><br /><em>They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more;</em>  <em>the sun shall not strike them,</em>    <em>nor any scorching heat.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3895.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p><em>For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,</em>  <em>and he will guide them to springs of living water,</em><br /><em>and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3896.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p>
