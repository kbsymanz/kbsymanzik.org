<p>Well... I guess one way to deal with a hole in the road is to put an old tire around it, some rocks in the tire, a tree branch in it, mark it with a yellow plastic bag and put a saw-horse next to it.........<br /><img src="/images/legacy/1965.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>But, if it's a hole in the sidewalk, just make sure you are watching where you walk!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/1966.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
