<p>Mikayla and the rest of the middle school went on their yearly outdoor education trip.  This time they went to Taal, a volcano in the Northern Philippines.  While there, they were taught how to properly kill a chicken (which they later ate).  Here Mikayla shares this valuable knowledge with you in easy to follow steps should you ever find yourself in need of killing a chicken for dinner.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/565.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="476" /><br /><em>First, you grab the chicken by the feet ...</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/566.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="545" /><br /><em>and swing it round and round in order to get it dizzy.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/567.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="490" /><br /><em>Then you lay the chicken on the ground and put a metal bar over it's neck.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/568.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="519" /><br /><em>You then place both your feet on the bar while still holding the chicken's feet...</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/569.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="450" /><br /><em>Then you simply jerk the chicken up by the feet to cleanly separate the chicken's head from it's body.</em></p><p>Now you know how to kill a chicken.</p>
