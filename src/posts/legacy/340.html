<p>Mikayla is on an Outdoor Education Trip to Subic Bay this week with the Middle School.<br />She recently finished playing basketball for the Middle School Girls Basketball team.  She enjoyed that and is looking forward to starting Girl's Soccer - Middle School and High School combined team.<br />Already she is thinking about colleges!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1005.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>Kirsten is doing well in 5th grade.  She is getting taller.  Currently she is playing soccer in the Elementary After School Sports program and enjoying that.  She looks forward to starting Middle School and being able to go on the OE trip they take every year.<br />She really enjoys art and misses the art teacher she had in the US.  She is an avid reader and sketches often.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1006.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>Benjamin is doing well in 1st grade.  He, also, is in a growth spurt and playing after school soccer.  He is looking forward to our trip to the US in May and being able to fish at Grandpa's pond.  Ben loves to fish and he and I are praying that God makes him a fisher of men.<br />He has a very tender heart toward God and praying for the salvation of his relatives and neighbors who are not saved yet.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1007.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>James is a bundle of 15 month old toddler energy.  He keeps us all on our toes.  He loves to climb, throw balls, play outside.  His smile can melt your heart!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1008.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>Jerard continues to show improvement in coordination and strength.  Monday he starts physical therapy three times a week.  We will be focusing on getting him to keep his balance for sitting up and walking.  His smile also can melt your heart!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1004.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p>
