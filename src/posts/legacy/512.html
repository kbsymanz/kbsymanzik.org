<p><em>"In times of trouble go not out of yourself to seek aid;</em><br /><em>for the whole benefit of trial consists in silence, patience, rest, and</em><br /><em>resignation.  In this condition divine strength is found for the hard</em><br /><em>warfare, because God Himself fights for the soul."</em>  Miquel de Molinos (1640-97)</p><p>2 Peter 2:9 "The Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials," </p>
