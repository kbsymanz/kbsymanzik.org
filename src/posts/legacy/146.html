<p>Ben loves to play pretend.  </p><p>Recently he received 'Army pants' from one of his Aunts and an army vest from a friend here.</p><p>In Kindergarten they've been learning about King David.  For years I've been praying over Ben that he will grow to be a man after God's own heart like King David; a strong warrior and a tender hearted man.  Ben is showing signs of both as he grows and develops.</p><p>So it was fun to see him playing "Army" - as in commando and yet he was King David!!! (Really, he has a sucker in his mouth, not a cig!!!)</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/483.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/494.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
