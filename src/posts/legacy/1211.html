<p>2 years ago today Jerard went to Heaven with Jesus.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3654.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3760.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p>About 10 days after he died I had this dream - I have copied it here from my diary writings.</p><p><strong>Monday May 28, 2012</strong><br />2am I awaken from a dream.  <br />Jerard was standing in a beautiful green, lush field, with a gorgeous sun/Son shining.  He was standing on strong, sturdy legs and he sang me a song to the tune of "God Be With You Til We Meet Again."  It was beautiful.  His innocent, child voice, so clear, so strong, so wonderful to hear.<br /><em>I am standing in Jesus' presence</em><br /><em>whole and moving arms and hands</em><br /><em>seeing Jesus, laughing, I am whole</em> <br /><em>I am Jesus' lamb He loves me so</em><br /><em>Mom I love you</em><br /><em>Mom I love you</em> <br /><em>thanks for taking care of me</em><br /><em>burden lifted off</em><br /><em>all's forgiven</em> <br /><em>I am standing now with Jesus Christ.</em><br /><em>Smiling, talking, running, whole</em> <br /><em>Christ my Saviour loves me so</em><br /><em>I know you miss me, cry your tears</em><br /><em>I am Jesus' lamb so have no fear</em><br /><em>Mom I love you</em> <br /><em>Mom I love you</em> <br /><em>Tell my brother James I love him, too</em><br /><em>Thank you for taking me</em><br /><em>giving life and love</em><br /><em>I am Jesus' lamb He's made me whole.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3759.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3713.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p>I am so thankful for Jeard, for my visitor from Heaven.</p>
