<p>Happy New Year from us to you!</p><p>Elisabeth Elliott well expresses my thoughts on this New Year's Day.</p><p>"New Year's Day is a good time to fix one's eyes on the only One who knows what the year is to hold.......My goal is God Himself - not joy, nor peace, nor even blessing, but Himself, my God.  'Tis His to lead me there, not mine, but His - At any cost, dear Lord, by any road!  So faith bounds forward to its goal in God and love can trust her Lord to lead her there; Upheld by Him, my soul is following hard, Till God hath full fulfilled my deepest prayer...."<br />(from "Secure In the Everlasting Arms" by Elisabeth Elliott)</p><p><em>"Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy</em><br /><em>strength be" Deuteronomy 33:25</em></p>
