<p>Our new rental has a Star Fruit tree in the front yard.  The fruit tastes a bit like a mix of crisp apple and sweet grapes.  It's good!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4152.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>Star Fruit</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4153.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>It's also known as Carambola.</em><br /><em>It is native to the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, India,</em> <em>Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4154.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4155.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>James in the branches of the star fruit tree.</em></p><p>Another fruit we recently picked up at the market for the first time is called spondias - also known as the Spanish plum.  It's a bit like eating an apple in texture and taste.  Lamay kaayo!  (very good!)</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4156.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p>
