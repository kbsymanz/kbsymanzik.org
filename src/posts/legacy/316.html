<p>We arrived in Davao November 22, 2006.</p><p>Now, today is our 2nd year here.  </p><p>We are glad to be here and we thank God  for our family of supporters who make it possible for us to be here.  </p><p>Psalm 126:2 Our mouths were filled with laughter,       our tongues with songs of joy.       Then it was said among the nations,       "The <span class="caps">LORD</span> has done great things for them."</p> <strong>3 The <span class="caps">LORD</span> has done great things for us,</strong>       <strong>and we are filled with joy.</strong>
