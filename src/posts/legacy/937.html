<p>We hear people in the <span class="caps">USA</span> are paying $3 or more per bottle of coconut juice for about 16 ounces!<br />Well, here, at the market, you can obtain fresh buyang (young coconut), <br /><img src="/images/legacy/3014.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />cut it open,<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3016.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />pour out about 16 ounces or more of fresh juice,<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3015.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />for only about .35 -.45cents! <br />(Often we get them free from neighbors with coconut trees in their yards who share with us!!!)</p><p>Come visit us and we'll walk you through the process!  It's great!!!</p>
