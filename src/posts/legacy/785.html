<p>Today is Kirsten's 13th Birthday!!!!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2547.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="450" /><br />She is a real blessing to us!  </p><p>Kirsten, Your Dad and I pray that out of God's glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your heart through faith. (We are thankful you've accepted Christ as your Saviour!)<br />And we pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord's holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,  and to know this love that surpasses knowledge--that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.<br />In Christ's Holy Name we pray, Amen and Amen.</p>
