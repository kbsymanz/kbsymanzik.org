<p>Ben has struggled a bit this school year with reading.  </p><p>But the Pizza Hut Book-It! program was highly motivating to him to read 15 minutes a day and record it in a log. </p> Monthly he earned a coupon for personal pan pizza.  He and I would go for a 'mother-son date' to the local Pizza Hut (yes!  There is a Pizza Hut here!)<p>Today he was awarded a certificate and a medal for completing all six months of the program.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1745.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Ben's reading is better.  And he has learned an important life skill of sticking to a task even if it is hard.<br />Keep praying for him as he works on his reading, writing, and arithmetic!  Thanks!</p><p><em>Hebrews 12:11 For the moment all discipline seems painful</em><br /><em>rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of</em> <em>righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</em> </p>
