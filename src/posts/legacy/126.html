<p>Saturday we went on a snorkeling trip with colleagues to Talicud Island.  </p><p>We stopped at two snorkeling sites - one called 'Coral Garden' and one called 'The Wall'.  When I'm snorkeling I feel like I'm living out a National Geographic special.  The scenery under the water is absolutely gorgeous!!!!! </p><p>We ate lunch on the beach at Talicud Island.  It was a lot of fun. <br />And for the first time our family survived a day on the ocean without sunburn thanks to sunscreen sent to us from the states!!!!!  We were happy about that!!!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/396.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/394.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/397.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
