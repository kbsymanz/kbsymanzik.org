<p>This is the final <span class="caps">ISAC</span> Soccer (Football) update for this school year.</p><p>The girls played two games today.  </p><p>They tied the first one and then lost it in the tie-breaking kick off thing(I'm not up on my terminology for that).</p><p>They then played in the playoff against the 6th ranked team (they entered this playoff as the 5th out of 8 teams).  They lost this match but it was a well-fought game and the girls had fun!</p><p>They are happy with their 6th place overall ranking.</p><p>Tonight they attend a banquet for all the <span class="caps">ISAC</span> participants.<br />Tomorrow they will go to church, a mall, and then return to Davao in the evening!</p><p>I'm glad they did as well as they did.  They only had enough players to go up to field a team with one substitute (12 players).  And one of the players sprained her ankle yesterday and is hobbling around on crutches, so today there were no subs!</p><p>(Mikayla texted me to let me know she purchased some Starbucks coffee for me! She knows her Mom's love for a good cup of coffee!)</p>
