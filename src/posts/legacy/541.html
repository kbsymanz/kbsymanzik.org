<p>March seems to be the month that braces will enter our family!</p><p>Kirsten will be getting braces on her teeth to help straighten and align them.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1738.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="149" /></p><p>Jerard will be getting a <span class="caps">SWASH</span> brace (<span class="caps">SWASH</span> stands for Standing, Walking, and Sitting Hip orthosis) the second week of March.<br />The cool thing about this <span class="caps">SWASH</span> brace is that instead of us needing to travel up to Manila to obtain it, they are bringing it down here!  What a blessing.<br />This brace will go around his waist and attach to his upper thighs, giving him assistance to sit up and balance better!<br />You can read more about it at http://www.allardusa.com/</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1737.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="123" /></p>
