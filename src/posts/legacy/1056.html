<p>This is a favourite prayer of mine....I share it with you!!!</p><p>Lord, grant me to greet the coming day in peace. Help me in all things to rely upon Your holy will.  In every hour of the day, reveal Your will to me. Bless my dealings with all who surround me. Teach me to treat all that come to me throughout the day with peace of soul and with firm conviction that Your will governs all.  In all my deeds and words, guide my thoughts and feelings.  In unforeseen events, let me not forget that all things are under your care.  Teach me to act firmly and wisely, without embittering and embarrassing others.  Give me strength to bear the fatigue of the coming day and all that it shall bring.  Direct my will, teach me to pray, pray Yourself in me.  Amen.</p><p>and another version of this prayer is this:</p><p>Lord, grant me to greet the coming day in peace. Help me in all things to rely upon Your holy will.
