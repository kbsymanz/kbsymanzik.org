<p>In my email, Monday through Friday, I receive a "Daily Growth Scripture Reading" from Ken Boa's ministry.</p><p>He wrote a book titled "Conformed To His Image" which is about biblical and practical approaches to Spiritual Formation.  It explores twelve facets of the gem of the spiritual life. These are relational, paradigm, disciplined, exchanged life, motivated, devotional, holistic, process, Spirit-filled, warfare, nurturing, and corporate spirituality. This book seeks to offer a comprehensive, balanced, and applicable approach to what it really means to know Christ.<br />I highly recommend reading it.</p><p>(email address is dailygrowth@kenboa.org)<br />(web address is http://www.kenboa.org/reflections)</p><p>Below is an example of what the Daily Growth email looks like.  They are scripture based and encouraging.</p><p>Blessings!!!</p><p><strong>Daily Growth</strong></p><p>Daily Growth for October 14, 2013<br />Daily Scripture<br />Prayers of Affirmation: Part 7</p><p><strong>Scripture Prayer Guide</strong></p><p>If Your law had not been my delight,<br />I would have perished in my affliction.
