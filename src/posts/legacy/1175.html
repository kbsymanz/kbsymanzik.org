<p>On Sunday January 5th in the evening,  I was kicking a soccer ball around with James when I tripped over the ball!  I put my left arm out to stop my fall and landed hard on my wrist, jarred my elbow and shoulder too.  My family took good care of me that night after the accident, making bags of ice to put on all the swelling joints!<br />I went to the doctor and thankfully, nothing is broken, but I am wearing a wrist splint for at least a week while my very achy arm and wrist heal.<br />Please pray my arm heals up well with no residual problems!  Thanks!</p>
