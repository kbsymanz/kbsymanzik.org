Job 23:12</em></strong></p><p>I've been studying the book of Job and really find the above verse so true.  His Word is more delightful than food.  His Word is my lamp.<br />We really do not live by bread alone, but by His Word.</p><p><em>Matthew 4:4  ""Man shall not live by bread alone,</em>    <em>but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"</em></p>
