<p>I, Beth, am up in Cebu for a few days visiting a dear friend who moved up here from Davao about three months ago.  It is wonderful to spend time with her and her husband, meet the teams they work with in church planting and livelihood projects, and enjoy good conversation and fun.<br />Originally I had booked a flight up here to take the <span class="caps">GRE</span> for the graduate program I am applying to, but the college waived the <span class="caps">GRE</span> requirement for me, so instead of wasting the ticket, I am enjoying a few days visiting my friend.</p><p>It always amazes me the passion my Filipino Christian brothers and sisters have in sharing the gospel and church planting and discipleship.  I am blessed to meet so many new brothers and sisters in Christ.</p><p>Pray for my friend, her husband and the teams that work in the Cebu area sharing Christ with non-churched people here.  The needs are great.</p>
