<p>After consulting with three of Jerard's doctors yesterday, this is what we've learned :  <br />~The function Jerard lost in this last major seizure episode he will most likely not regain.  We'd noticed that also from his seizures in 2010 - after losing the left side function of his body he really hadn't regained any use even with physical therapy.<br />So we are looking at a "new normal".  He is quiet, doesn't move much.  He will continue to be fed with a naso-gastric tube for another 3 - 4 months.  Then, if no swallowing has returned, he will have a permanent tube inserted into his stomach (so he doesn't have a tube hanging out of his nose all the time.)<br />He continues to take two anti-seizures medications and get nebulized every four hours for breathing.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2937.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
