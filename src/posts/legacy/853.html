<p>All Saint's Day was recently celebrated October 31 - November 2nd here in the Philippines.  It is also known as Todos los Santos and Und√°s, All Saints Day in the Philippines is observed in remembrance of the dead. Families return to their respective provinces to clean and repair the tombs of their deceased loved ones, and to pay their respects. <br />The cemeteries become extremely busy and almost carnival-like.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2783.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2784.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2785.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2786.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
