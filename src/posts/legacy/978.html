<p><img src="/images/legacy/3175.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Five days before Jerard died was Mother's Day.<br />Ben's then fourth grade class prepared a gift for each of the moms of a large container of homemade pancake mix, measuring cups and spoons, and syrup for the pancakes.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3174.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />Ben, along with the help of his Dad, made wonderful pancakes for our breakfast that morning.<br /><em>who knows what Kurt is sticking in his ears!!!?!?!?</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3176.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br />I thought I'd share the recipe with you in two versions...the original, and the one we've modified it to be.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3177.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><strong>Original Pancake Mix</strong> </p><p>Mix well together the following:<br />3 cups flour<br />1 1/2 tsp salt<br />3 Tablespoons baking powder<br />3 Tablespoons sugar<br />1 cup powdered milk<br />Mix well and store in airtight container (and in ref to keep ants out!)</p><p><strong>To Use:</strong><br />1 egg<br />1 cup water<br />1 Tablespoon oil<br />1 1/2 cups mix<br />Mix well.  Fry on lightly oiled pan.</p><p>We like this recipe so well we usually triple the mix and store in a large lock n' lock box in the ref since we have pancakes just about every morning.  Its much more cost-effective then buying cereal here.   I've also modified the recipe somewhat:</p><p>7 cups white flour<br />2 cups oatmeal<br />1 cup wheat germ<br />1 Tablespoon salt<br />9 Tablespoons baking powder (1/2 cup + 1 T)<br />1/2 cup sugar (brown or white)<br />3 cups powdered milk<br />Sift together well.  Store in ref.</p><p>To use take <br />1 1/2 cups mix<br />1 egg<br />1 cup water<br />mix well.<br />I sometimes add 1 tsp vanilla and/or 1/2 tsp cinnamon.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3178.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerard used to love to eat pancakes.  It was one of his</em><br /><em>favourite foods along with graham crackers.</em><br /><em>This picture was taken the day before he died.  He was really</em><br /><em>sleepy and seemed to be uncomfortable most of the day;</em><br /><em>but laying on the floor kept him cooler and seemed to</em><br /><em>be soothing to him.....miss you, buddy.</em></p>
