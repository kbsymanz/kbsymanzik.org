<p>I want to share a prayer from Brennan Manning's book "Reflections for Ragamuffins."  It speaks to what God has been teaching me.</p><p>Poverty is more than just 'lack of money.'  Poor people tend to talk about poverty in terms of shame, inferiority, powerlessness, humiliation, fear, hopelessness, depression, voicelessness...in this context, we all are poor.  God is using the poverty that Kurt and I see around us on a daily basis to show us more about the relational-ness of Him.   He and I will be blogging more about this.  <br /><sub>(and if you want to read a great book,read "When Helping Hurts" by</sub> <sub>Steve Corbett and Brian Fikkert.)</sub></p><p>Today, I just want to share this prayer with you.</p><p>"Jesus, my Brother and Lord, I pray as I write these words for the grace to be truly poor before you,<br />to recognize and accept my weakness and humanness,<br />to forgo the indecent luxury of self-hatred,<br />to celebrate your mercy and trust in your power when I'm at my weakest,<br />to rely on your love no matter what I may do,<br />to seek no escapes from my innate poverty,<br />to accept loneliness when it comes instead of seeking substitutes,<br />to live peacefully without clarity or assurance,<br />to stop grandstanding and trying to get attention,<br />to do the truth quietly without display,<br />to let the dishonesties of my life fade away,<br />to belong no more to myself,<br />not to desert my post when I give the appearance of staying at it,<br />to cling to my humanity,<br />to accept the limitations and full responsibility of being a human being - <br />really human<br />and really poor in Christ our Lord."</p><p><em>The Lord is good to those whose hope is in HIM</em><br /><em>to the one who seeks him;</em><br /><strong><em>it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord.</em></strong><br /><em>Lamentations 3:25-26</em></p>
