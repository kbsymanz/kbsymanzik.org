<p>Just wanted to share some pics with you from other events happening around here!</p><p>A few weeks ago there was a talent show at school.  Kirsten's 4th grade class performed as a praise band.  Kirsten played keyboard.  They played "Father, I adore You" with guitar, keyboard, bells, violins, recorder....it was very pretty music.</p><p>Kirsten continues to excel in her studies.  She is a big help with the babies too.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/546.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten at keyboard</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/547.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The 4th grade Praise Band</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/552.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten and James having fun</em></p><p>Ben has started t-ball.

The middle school does this every year.  It is an out door ed and spiritual retreat week.  Last year Mikayla went to Corrigador, a WW II site.<br />Mikayla is looking forward to the trip.  Pray for her and the whole middle school group and sponsors to have a spiritually enriching time; a fun, educational time exploring the volcano; and a safe trip.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/548.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla and Ben helping with James and Jerard</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/549.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228" /><br /><em>A scene from Corrigador; last year's OE trip</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/531.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Studying!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/551.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228" /><br /><em>A scene from Corrigador; last year's OE trip</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/554.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James and Jerard - Jerard is looking better</em></p>
