<p>We had hoped that by the end of May we could travel back to the <span class="caps">USA</span> with James, adoption done.  But it does not look like that will be the case.  We are still awaiting the adoption decision from the court before we can proceed with getting travel papers for James.  These can take 6 - 8 months to obtain after a favourable court decision on the adoption is finalized.<br />We will all be staying here in the Philippines until James is officially adopted and able to travel with us back to the <br /><span class="caps">USA</span>.  So, this summer, instead of us coming to the <span class="caps">USA</span>, Mikayla </p><p>will be coming here to spend some time with us before college starts again in the fall.<br />We look forward to her visit.</p><p><strong>Please keep James' adoption in your prayers.</strong><br /><strong>We would really like to receive the adoption approval soon.</strong></p><p>We rest in full assurance that all is happening in God's timing for His glory and our good.  We praise Him for His leading.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3492.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /></p><p>James 4:  13 </p><p>Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit"-- 14 yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.</p><p>Proverbs 16: 1- 3 </p><p>The plans of the heart belong to man,<br />but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord.<br />All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes,<br />but the Lord weighs the spirit.<br />Commit your work to the Lord,<br />and your plans will be established.</p><p>Proverbs 19:21  </p><p>Many are the plans in the mind of a man,<br />but it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand.</p><p>James 1:5 <span class="caps">ESV</span> </p> If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. <p>Proverbs 27:1 </p><p>Do not boast about tomorrow,<br />for you do not know what a day may bring.</p><p>Matthew 6:33-34  </p><p>But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.  "Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.</p><p>2 Corinthians 1: 12 - 22   Paul's Change of Plans</p><p>12 For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you. 13 For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand and I hope you will fully understand-- 14 just as you did partially understand us--that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you.</p><p>15 Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace. 16 I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea. 17 Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to the flesh, ready to say "Yes, yes" and "No, no" at the same time? 18 As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No. 19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes. 20 For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory. 21 And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, 22 and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</p>
