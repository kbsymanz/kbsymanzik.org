<p>Jerard has been admitted to the Pediatric <span class="caps">ICU</span> at Davao Docs Hospital.<br />The neurologist is hopeful that his seizures were set off by a viral infection and nothing more.  If that is the case, we could be discharged from hospital within 24 - 36 hours and bring Jerard home on maintenance medications for siezure prevention.<br />We are waiting for lab test results.<br />There is no sign of shunt infection.  <br />Keep us in your prayers.  <br />Thanks.</p><p>It's amazing God's providence in all this.  Just this past month we received a financial gift from someone to help cover "any future medical care needs of Jerard."  God is so awesome!!!!!</p>
