<p><img src="/images/legacy/3341.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>cleaning out the kitchen cabinets yesterday, looking for the</em><br /><em>Christmas cookie cutters, I came across</em><br /><em>IV tubing from Jerard's last hospitalization when he came home</em><br /><em>with an IV for us to continue his medicines.</em><br /><em>I thought I'd thrown that out a long time ago.</em></p><p><em>Tears ran down my face as I held that tubing, remembering</em><br /><em>my little guy, his smile, his patience, his soft breath on my neck</em><br /><em>when I held him.</em><br /><em>And for a while I really missed the sleepless nights and</em><br /><em>getting up at various hours of the night to give him</em><br /><em>medicines and snuggles.</em></p><p><em>I hugged the tubing to my body before putting it into the</em><br /><em>outgoing trash.</em></p><p><em>letting go and moving on.</em></p><p><em>Grief ebbs and flows.</em></p><p><em>someone recently emailed me that it would be great for Jerard</em><br /><em>this holiday season to be spending his first Christmas in heaven</em><br /><em>with the Reason for the season.</em></p><p><em>Yes, it's great Jerard is in Heaven.  But there are moments</em><br /><em>my momma heart really misses him.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3342.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><em>His brother misses him, too.  We were baking cookies and he</em><br /><em>spontaneously said to me, "I miss my brother."</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3345.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>I hugged him.  We took a picture of Jerard and the figurines</em><br /><em>representing each of my children...</em><br /><em>and soon he was busy having fun rolling out the</em><br /><em>dough, eating the dry flour (he says it tastes good), taking</em><br /><em>cookies off the trays after they were baked.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3346.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3343.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><em>In a couple days we will frost the cookies as a family;</em><br /><em>and James will be having a frosting party with some friends,</em><br /><em>too.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3344.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><em>Life goes on.</em><br /><em>Grief ebbs and flows.</em><br /><em>Jerard is missed and yet there is a thankfulness he is no</em><br /><em>longer trapped in a body not working right for him.  He is</em><br /><em>with Jesus!!!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3347.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><em>Advent is the preparation of Christ coming as a baby.</em></p><p><em>John Piper wrote a great poem - I share it with you, now...</em></p><p><em>Advent Beauty</em><br /><em>Tilting on her yearly track</em><br /><em>Advent beauty circles back,</em><br /><em>Flying faster with the years,</em><br /><em>Hardly giving time for tears</em><br /><em>First to dry upon the cheek--</em><br /><em>Has it been more than a week</em><br />_Since we laid both young and old_â€¨<br /><em>In the ground now winter cold?</em></p><p><em>Has there really been a spring</em><br /><em>When the birds began to sing?</em><br /><em>Has there been both summer, fall</em><br /><em>Since the Baby in the stall</em><br /><em>Called us with a Christmas bell</em><br /><em>to sing, O Come, Immanuel?</em><br /><em>Tilting on her yearly track</em><br /><em>Advent beauty circles back,</em><br /><em>Flying faster with the years--</em><br /><em>Ah, but overtaking fears.</em><br /><em>Let the Lord of advent lift</em><br /><em>Every care (an early gift!);</em><br /><em>See the Savior and the Son</em><br /><em>Shine in advent candle one.</em></p>
