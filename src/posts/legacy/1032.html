<p>There are times in every life when the enemy seems to be working extra hard, like a roaring lion, to tear apart believers.<br />Our family is experiencing some hardships that I can't explain fully here now and we would really appreciate your prayers for each of our kids and for us.</p><p>Psalm 143:3 For the enemy has pursued my soul;    he has crushed my life to the ground;    he has made me sit in darkness like those long dead.<br />4 Therefore my spirit faints within me;    my heart within me is appalled.</p>
