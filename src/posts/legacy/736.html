<p>Mothering is hard work and to be honest, it has taken me a while to re-mold my priorities back to being a stay-at-home mom of toddlers again.  When my older three were little I was a stay-at-home and home-schooling Mom.  I'm so thankful I was able to stay at home with them.</p><p>Our three older kids were all school-aged when James and Jerard came into our lives.  I was "doing ministry" outside the home with our mission's guest house and as hospitality coordinator to new missionaries coming on to the field.</p><p>But God, in His infinite patience and wisdom, has worked a change of heart in me to desire again the role of full-time homemaker/Mom.  We only get one chance to really impart scriptural truths to our kids and the soil is so fertile in their little hearts as toddlers.  I can honestly tell you I am enjoying being a stay-at-home mom again.  James and I enjoy playing, reading, baking.  He loves to be outside.  Jerard loves me to throw a ball with him, sing, massage his limbs, sing and talk to him.  These two boys are such blessings.</p><p>And God has been encouraging me to memorize His word and pray scripture for my kids.  His Word is our lamp and light.  His Word is our food.  </p><p>We've traveled over (and continue to travel over) many rough roads here on the mission field.  He alone is our rock (Psalm 18, 19, 27, 31, etc...)</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2142.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p>Praying for my children is a high spiritual priority for me. Spiritual growth in my children's lives is accomplished by the power of Jesus. "For it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure." (Philippians 2:13). </p><p>As each of my kids have dealt with various issues in their lives, I have tried to pray based on scripture for that situation.  Truly  "the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart." (Hebrews 4:12)</p><p>It is humbling and awe-inspiring to see my Abba work in the lives of each of my family members and in me.  Here is one scriptural prayer I've been praying for each member of this family.  Perhaps you'd like to pray it for yourself and your kids too!<br />(Based on an article by John Piper - http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/taste-see-articles/how-to-pray-for-the-soulyours-or-anothers)</p><p>Dear Loving Abba,<br />Incline (my - insert names of whomever you are praying for) heart and soul to You; to desire deeply and passionately to know You.  Incline _______ heart to Your testimonies and not to gain (Ps. 119:36).  Open the eyes of ________ heart to see all the wonderful things from Your law (Ps. 119:18).  Enlighten ____ heart to perceive the glory in Your word. (Eph. 1:18).<br />Father, You know the condition of ____ heart, how fragmented our hearts are as humans.  Parts of our heart can be enlightened while parts are in the dark.  I long for ____ heart to be united with You, God.  Create healing and wholeness in ____ heart - unite ____ heart to fear Your name (Ps. 86:11).  Satisfy ___ in the morning with Your steadfast love, that ____ will rejoice and be glad all (my/his/her/their) days. (Ps 90:14).  But I don't want ___ happiness to be fragile or weak, but to be strong and durable in the face of the worst adversities You see fit to ordain.  Grant ___ to be strengthened with power through Your Holy Spirit in the inner man (Eph. 3:16)  I do not desire this strength to be simply for (myself), but for others.  It truly is more blessed to give than to receive (Acts 20:35) so produce good deeds and works of love for others so that Your glory will be seen in ____ life and others will taste and see that You are good.  Help ____ walk in a manner worthy of You, Lord, bearing fruit in every good work. (Col. 1:10)<br />I pray all this in the name of Jesus Christ.  <br />``````````````</p><p>Check out these resources: - - http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/10-reasons-to-pray-the-scriptures - - "Praying the Scriptures for Your Teenagers" and also, "Praying the Scriptures for your Children" both by Jodie Berndt<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2345.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="160" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2346.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="160" /></p>
