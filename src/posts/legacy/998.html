<p>Conversation with my four year old - <br />James "when I get dead I get to see Jerard?"<br />Me - "Yes"<br />James - "And when you get dead you'll see Jerard?"<br />Me - "Yes"<br />James - "And when Daddy gets dead he'll see Jerard?"<br />Me - "Yes"<br />James - "And when Ben gets dead he'll see Jerard?"<br />Me - "Yes"<br />James - "And when Lala and Kirsten get dead they'll see Jerard?"<br />Me - "Yes"<br />James - "So when we all get dead we will all be together and we will all see Jerard and be with Jesus forever?"<br />Me - "Yes"<br />James - "I miss Jerard.  I am sad he is gone.  But I'll see him again, right?"<br />Me - "Yes, honey, you will see him again!"</p><p>Moments like these melt a momma's heart!  Thank You, Jesus, for James' tender heart.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3173.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
