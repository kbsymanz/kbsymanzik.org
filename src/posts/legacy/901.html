<p>This morning Beth and I awoke to find that Jerard was having seizures again.  It was actually James who discovered it. He came out of the room that he shares with Jerard at about 5:45 am saying, "Daddy, I want to show you something in my room." He led me into his room to show me Jerard in bed having a seizure. Needless to say, that got Beth and I into high gear.</p><p>We had him at the hospital ER shortly thereafter and it took several medicines and about 4 hours before his seizures went away. Right now he is at the hospital still in the pediatric intensive care unit. He will spend the night there and he will have a <span class="caps">CAT</span> scan tomorrow as long as he remains seizure free until then.</p><p>Please keep him and us in your prayers.</p>
