<p>This summer has been busy with moving, dentist appointments, and some short family trips.  This coming week we will be attending a Bible dedication and going on a one day boat trip.<br />We are pretty much settled into our new rental house.  When our internet is finally hooked up and activated I will post more photos!<br />Jerard starts 'preschool' this week at Resources For The Blind.  He will attend Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings.  We've hired a kuya to take him (kuya means older brother).  He is very good with Jerard and fully capable of carrying him up to the third floor where the preschool meets!<br />James is our highly active three year old.  He's been enjoying having Mikayla, Kirsten, and Ben around this summer to play with!<br />Kirsten has had several dentist appointments this summer - not much fun, but she's also enjoyed turning 13, our mother/daughter retreat, family vacation, reading and shopping!<br />Ben passed to his green belt in karate.  He is getting taller and we just bought new shoes for him yesterday since he's outgrown his other ones!  He is now a men's size 7 and still growing!  He turns ten on August 3rd - the day before school starts!<br />Mikayla has been reading, baby sitting, looking at colleges and other career ideas for after high school.  She is glad for friends returning from furloughs and for a friend who moved away coming to visit for three weeks.<br />Kurt is busy with his projects at work and will be going to Bangkok, Thailand in October for meetings!<br />I took one class this summer on marriage counseling taught by a visiting professor from the <span class="caps">USA</span>.  I've been busy organizing our house and being mom to 5 great kids!<br />We are looking forward to my sister's visit in August!  It will be our first visitor from the <span class="caps">USA</span> in the four years we've lived here!<br />Blessings on your day!</p>
