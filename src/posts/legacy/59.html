<p>Tomorrow, Monday April 2,  we will start moving into our rental house.  </p><p>The painters have been busy painting.  Other workers have been busy fixing some plumbing problems, water-rotted ceiling tiles, and increasing the security wall height.</p><p>Pray for us as we transfer to the rental house.  </p><p>We are looking forward to having a house to live in!</p><p>We may not be updating this site for a few days until we get our internet up at the house!</p><p>(P.S.  In Filipino culture it is called 'transferring' if you are moving within the general area of the city or province.  We would be 'moving' if we left the area totally and went to a different country or northern Philippines.)</p>
