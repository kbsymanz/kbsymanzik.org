<p><img src="/images/legacy/3995.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p>Merry Christmas and Happy New year from us to you!</p><p>We are thankful James' adoption was completed.  Now we are working on his immigration papers for the <span class="caps">USA</span> and hope to come to the <span class="caps">USA</span> the summer of 2015.<br />This raises many transitional issues for us.  The Philippines has been our home for almost 9 years.  We love the people and this beautiful country, yet we feel a pull to return to our passport country.  Our children need to acclimate to the <span class="caps">USA</span> culture for college and beyond; we miss our family and friends.  </p><p>Quick updates on us - <br /><img src="/images/legacy/3998.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br />Mikayla has been busy tutoring Koreans in English and helping teach 8th grade Bible class at Faith and helping with the first grade reading groups.  She begins online university in January majoring in elementary education.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3996.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br />Kirsten is a junior and doing very well academically.
