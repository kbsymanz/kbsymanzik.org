<p>Last night we attended the sports award ceremony at Faith International Academy.  Kirsten earned a letter and also received the best defense, a.k.a. StoneWall Kirsten, award.  She is really excellent as a defender and stopping balls that the other team is trying to score into the net!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4102.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="244" /><br /><em>Kirsten and Janey are great friends, class mates, and team</em><br /><em>members!</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/4103.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="224" /></p>
