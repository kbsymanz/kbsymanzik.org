<p>I'm reading a great book by Stephen James and David Thomas.  It is about the art of nurturing boys.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2751.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="180" /></p><p>My three sons add a depth of joy and frustration to my life that only causes me to bend deeply before His throne of grace for help to parent well!  I have a friend in the states who says the same thing about her 4 sons - they are a cause of great joy, much prayer, frustration, fun.....</p><p>I thank God for Ben, James, and Jerard!  They are all blessings!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2750.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2749.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2748.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p>
