<p>James was discharged this afternoon from the hospital.  We are thankful he only needed to stay one night in the hospital.  He is home now, getting breathing treatments every two hours for the next couple days along with medicines to treat the pneumonia and on-going asthma.  Thanks for praying for him.</p>
