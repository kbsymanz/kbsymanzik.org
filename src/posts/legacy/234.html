<p>It's been quite a week here for utilities!</p><p>We've been without internet for 3 or 4 days (but now, obviously, it's fixed!) It was finally fixed this afternoon.</p><p>We've had power outages and water stoppages several times this week.</p><p>Today, again, we have no running water <br />so when it started pouring rain tonight, <br />we took advantage of the shower and went outside to cool off, shampoo our hair and wash up a bit!!!</p>
