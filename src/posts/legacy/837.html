<p>Ben's 4th grade class presented a cute skit on Psalm 23 yesterday in chapel.  They also sang some great songs reminding us that the  Lord truly is our shepherd and He really does love us.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2735.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2736.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><em>1 The <span class="caps">LORD</span> is my shepherd; I shall not want.</em> <em>2He makes me lie down in green pastures.</em><br /><em>He leads me beside still waters.</em> <em>3He restores my soul.</em><br /><em>He leads me in paths of righteousness</em>   <em>for his name's sake.</em></p> <em>4Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,</em>   <em>I will fear no evil,</em><em>for you are with me;</em>   <em>your rod and your staff,</em>   <em>they comfort me.</em> <em>5You prepare a table before me</em>   <em>in the presence of my enemies;</em><em>you anoint my head with oil;</em>   <em>my cup overflows.</em><em>6Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me</em>  <em>all the days of my life,</em><em>and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD</em>    <em>forever.</em>
