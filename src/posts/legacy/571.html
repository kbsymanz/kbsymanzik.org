<p><img src="/images/legacy/1807.jpg" alt="" width="48" height="75" /><br /><em>This is an excellent book.  "So often we find ourselves</em><br /><em>caught between extremes.  Either we feel to much or not at all.</em><br /><em>We tend to ignore our feelings or fight them off as if they were</em><br /><em>the enemy.  But all emotion - whether positive or negative - can</em><br /><em>give us a glimpse of the true nature of God."</em></p><p>This is one of several books I am currently reading and I would highly recommend it.<br />Dr. Dan B. Allendar is one of my favourite authors.  Other books of his that I highly recommend are "The Healing Path", "The Wounded Heart", "To Be Told", and "How Children Raise Parents." </p>
