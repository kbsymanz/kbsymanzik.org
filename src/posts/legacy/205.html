<p>Thought I'd share a few pictures of the guys in our family.</p><p>We were blessed with the gift of a rocking chair.  The boys are really enjoying being rocked in it.  Ben found it comfotable enough to sleep in one night!!! Kurt and I are thankful for the nice chair!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/592.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/594.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/597.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>One night, James was fussing so Ben took him into his bed, read him a story, and was singing "Twinkle, Twinkle, little star" to his brother.    It melted this momma's heart!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/593.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/596.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Kurt with James and Jerard shortly after we arrived home from the last hospital stay.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/595.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
