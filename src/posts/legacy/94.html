<p>Well, Beth and I continue to take weekly language lessons and "hinay-hinay lang", we are slowly learning Cebuano.  In fact, we have recently stepped up our learning cycle with the addition of some Cebuano coaching lessons weekly too.  The Filipino office workers are speaking more Cebuano to me to help me learn as well.</p><p>Here is what I just learned today.  There are three different words in Cebuano that are spelled "baga".  One means <strong>lungs</strong>, another <strong>heat</strong>, and the last the word for <strong>thick</strong>.  The difference between them is that baga for lungs has a emphasis on the first syllable and a shortened last syllable (b&aacute;g&acirc;).  Baga for thick has a shortened last syllable without an emphasis on the first syllable (bag&agrave;).  Baga for heat does not have a shortened last syllable (baga).  I still don't know how to reliably pronounce them correctly but once I do I will practice by saying, "My lungs feel thick because of the heat" (Akong b&aacute;g&acirc; ning bag&aacute; tungod sa baga).</p>
