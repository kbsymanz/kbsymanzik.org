<p>Just this morning in family devotions we read about waiting and how often God directs us to wait.....</p><p>God had taught me much about waiting and resting in Him when I was caring for Jerard.  Deep in my soul I know it's better to just wait and rest for His timing to occur.....</p><p>but....there are moments waiting seems difficult......</p><p>we've been here nine years with no real furlough...</p><p>and I'm looking forward to getting back to the states to visit family and friends; to help my daughters adjust to life in the <span class="caps">USA</span> culture, help them learn to drive, take Kirsten to visit some college campuses,; start singing in the church choir again, etc....</p><p>but there is paperwork we need to complete which requires sending our passports in for....</p><p>and paperwork from the <span class="caps">USA</span> that we need to file I thought would soon be on its way to us has been only as of today started in the <span class="caps">USA</span> side...</p><p>another delay.....</p><p>another opportunity to wait on His timing.....</p><p>then we can file paperwork on our end and hopefully it will be processed in a few months.....</p><p>but we can't do that til some paperwork arrives from the <span class="caps">USA</span>....</p><p>then once all that stuff is processed, then we can purchase tickets for the <span class="caps">USA</span>.....</p><p>so this morning finds me reflectively in prayer....my anxiousness to purchase tickets and know I have a day to be flying to the <span class="caps">USA</span> tempered with His still small voice reminding me to wait....</p><p>I will listen.....</p><p>Psalm 27:14<br />Wait for the Lord; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the Lord!</p><p>Genesis 49:18<br />I wait for your salvation, O Lord.</p><p>Psalm 25<br />To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.......</p><p>O my God, in you I trust;....... none who wait for you shall be put to shame;.....Make me to know your ways, O Lord;    teach me your paths.</p><p>Lead me in your truth and teach me,    for you are the God of my salvation;    for you I wait all the day long......Good and upright is the Lord;    therefore he instructs sinners in the way.</p><p>He leads the humble in what is right,    and teaches the humble his way.</p><p>All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness,    for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.......<br />The friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him,    and he makes known to them his covenant.</p><p>My eyes are ever toward the Lord,    for he will pluck my feet out of the net.</p><p>Turn to me and be gracious to me,    for I am lonely and afflicted.</p><p>The troubles of my heart are enlarged;    bring me out of my distresses.</p><p>Consider my affliction and my trouble,    and forgive all my sins........<br />May integrity and uprightness preserve me,    for I wait for you.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3159.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><br /><em>one time as I held Jerard, my Abba spoke to me and said,</em><br /><em>"just as Jerard leans in to you, lean in to Me.  Rest in me."</em><br /><em>Yes, Dad, I rest in You!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4189.jpg" alt="" width="208" height="243" /></p>
