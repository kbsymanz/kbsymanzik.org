<p>For several years now another Mom and I have been organizing the after school elementary sports for soccer and baseball.  We have to work around the High School sports schedule for field usage.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1982.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kids during warm up time.</em></p><p>This week we started a four week season of after-school elementary soccer!  The kids play twice a week.  It is a lot of fun and I am so thankful for the other Moms who are helping with organizing, managing the snacks and organizing the end of season party!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1984.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Krys, on the left, is the other Mom who helps organize</em> <em>this sports program.  She orders the shirts and awards; sends</em><br /><em>out emails, prints fliers, etc.  She is fun to work with!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1979.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben, James, and some team mates looking at something prior</em><br /><em>to practice starting.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1980.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben loves playing soccer and is looking forward to being in</em><br /><em>Middle School and High School when he can play on the</em><br /><em>competitive team!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1981.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jessica, Krys' daughter, and Ben.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1983.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla is helping as an assistant with the little kids teams.</em><br /><em>For the K - 2nd graders its a bit like trying to organize chaos!</em><br /><em>I am helping coach the little kids, too!
