<p>Back in February of this year I had blogged that Kirsten would be needing braces (see February 18, 2010 entry).<br />The plan to get her braces had gotten side-tracked due to Jerard's health issues and expenses.<br />A few weeks ago, when she smiled, I noticed her teeth seemed rather straight to me so I had the dentist re-evaluate her teeth last week for whether or not braces were needed.<br />Praise God, the consensus was that she does not need any braces!<br />Kirsten is happy about that.  And I am thanking God for His blessing of not needing to pay for braces!!!! (though I do know He would've supplied the funding for that if we needed to go that route!)</p><p>Psalm 33:1-5<br /><em>Shout for joy in the <span class="caps">LORD</span>, O you righteous!</em>   <em>Praise befits the upright.</em><br /><em>Give thanks to the <span class="caps">LORD</span> with the lyre;</em>  <em>make melody to him with the harp of ten strings!</em><br /><em>Sing to him a new song;</em>  <em>play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts.</em></p> <em>For the word of the <span class="caps">LORD</span> is upright,</em>   <em>and all his work is done in faithfulness.</em><em>He loves righteousness and justice;</em>   <em>the earth is full of the steadfast love of the <span class="caps">LORD</span>.</em>
