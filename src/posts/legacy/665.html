<p>We had family photos taken yesterday by a professional photographer.  We were outside at an beautiful hotel setting by the beach!  I took some of my own photos while we were having photos taken!  Enjoy!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2059.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James, the photographer.
