<p>Often, I am awake at 4:30 reading, having quiet time with God, praying.  Then, in the distance I hear the muslim call to prayer starting...a sing song of calling to 'allah'.</p><p>And I think, "Faith is active.  We each search for our Dad, our heavenly Father.<br />He says, "seek me with all your heart" (Deut. 4:29 _ But if from_ <em>there you seek the Lord your God, you will find him if you seek</em><br /><em>him with all your heart and with all your soul</em><br />and in Psalm 27 it says <em>My heart says of you, "Seek his face!"</em>    <em>Your face, Lord, I will seek. Do not hide your face from me,</em></p><p>Jesus admonishes us to seek Him <em>seek first his kingdom and</em><br /><em>his righteousness,</em> Matthew 6:33"</p><p>Faith is active.  Throughout the Bible there are references to seek Him, to strive, to pursue.</p><p>One of my favourite passages that encourages active faith is Colossians 3.<br /><em>Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your</em><br /><em>hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right</em> <em>hand of God. 2 Set your minds on things above, not on earthly</em> <em>things. 3 For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ</em> <em>in God. 4 When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also</em> <em>will appear with him in glory.</em></p><p><em>5 Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly</em> <em>nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and</em><br /><em>greed, which is idolatry......8 But now you must also rid</em> yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice,_ slander, and filthy <em>language from your lips. 9 Do not lie to</em><br /><em>each other, since you have taken off your old self with its</em> <em>practices 10 and have put on the new self, which is being</em> <em>renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. ........</em> <em>Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved,</em> <em>clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility,</em> <em>gentleness and patience.</em> <br /><em>13 Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of</em> <br /><em>you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord</em> <em>forgave you. 14 And over all these virtues put on love, which</em> <em>binds them all together in perfect unity.</em></p><p><em>15 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as</em> <br /><em>members of one body you were called to peace. And be</em> <br /><em>thankful. 16 Let the message of Christ dwell among you</em> <br /><em>richly as you teach and admonish one another with all</em> <br /><em>wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit,</em> <em>singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. 17 And</em> <br /><em>whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in</em> <br /><em>the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the</em> <br /><em>Father through him.</em></p><p>I pray this passage often for my family and self.  that we "'put on"<br />"clothe ourselves" "let His peace rule" etc....</p><p>Faith is active.</p><p>Just as our M friends call to their Allah 5 times a day, may we each call to our God and Heavenly Father continually.</p>
