<p>Kurt had his 45th birthday yesterday!  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/436.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p> He was 23 when I met him.  We dated for five years (going our separate ways for one of those years), then married when he was 28.So,  22 years of his life have been spent with me! <p><img src="/images/legacy/16.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>I thank God for my husband.  He is a godly man.  He is a good Daddy to our children.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/57.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>1 Timothy 3: 1Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer,[a] he desires a noble task. 2Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 3not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. 4He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect. 5(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?) .... 8Deacons, likewise, are to be men worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. 9They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. 10They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons. </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/435.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/405.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/367.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/123.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/171.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/107.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/284.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="247" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/364.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
