<p>Jerard had a CT scan done this morning.  </p><p>The good news:<br />His ventricals are re-opening.  The fluid pockets with the drains are smaller.  </p><p>The bad news:<br />Other smaller fluid pockets have developed.  <br />But the most disconcerting finding is that the arachnoid cyst continues to grow larger.  This cyst can cause the other problems (i.e. fluid pockets, down-turned eyes, etc...)</p><p>Jerard will have surgery on Tuesday to drain the cyst.  <br />It will be done through an endoscope and will involve putting a shunt drain in from the cyst to the ventrical so that the <span class="caps">CFS</span> fluid building up inside the cyst can continually drain.</p><p>Jerard, overall, is in a healthy state.  He has a slight fever but is on antibiotics and antifungal medications for the <span class="caps">UTI</span> he has.</p><p>Pray for Jerard to tolerate and come through the surgery well.</p><p>Pray for our finances as Philippine hospitals are cash-based.</p><p>Pray for our neurosurgeon and his colleagues assisting with the surgery.  He and they are very caring, highly skilled men and we have complete confidence in their skills.</p><p>Pray for our family.</p><p>Thanks.</p>
