<p>I love to read and have recently finished reading the following:</p><p><em>Jane Eyre</em> by Charlotte Bronte</p><p><em>Bird by Bird</em> by Anne Lamott</p><p><em>Why do Christians Shoot Their Wounded?</em> by Dwight L. Carlson</p><p>I highly recommend each of those books if you are looking for something to read.</p><p>I am also currently reading</p><p><em>On Becoming a Person: A Therapist's View on Psychotherapy</em> by <br />Carl Rogers</p><p><em>A Praying Life</em> by Paul E. Miller</p><p><em>On Writing</em> by Stephen King</p><p><em>A Path Through Suffering</em> by Elisabeth Elliott</p><p><em>Love Beyond Reason</em> by John Ortberg</p><p>and I'm continuing to plow my way through <em>A Quest For</em><br /><em>Godliness</em> by J.I. Packer.  It's an excellent book but needs to be read slowly to absorb the content!</p><p>These are all good reads that I highly recommend!</p><p>I also really like the Gutenberg.org website that has free downloads of older books available.  I've recently down loaded  "The Pilgrim's Progress", by John Bunyon; "The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life" by Hannah Whitall Smith and "Parables of the Christ Life" and "Parables of the Cross" by Lillias Trotter.</p><p>Let me know what you are reading!</p>
