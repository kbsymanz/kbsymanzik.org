<p>Hi!</p><p>We've been enjoying visiting with our relatives, friends from our sending church, etc.<br />It's refreshing to be cold!  Michigan is having a cooler than usual late Spring.  Temps are 40f at night to around 70f during the day.</p><p>Yesterday we shared in a Sunday School class at our sending church and also a brief update during the morning service.  <br />I really enjoyed being able to sing in the Praise Band during the evening service also!</p><p>I hope to post some pictures soon!</p>
