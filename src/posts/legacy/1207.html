<p>The other morning  I was walking James to school.    </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3804.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p> We passed by the man with the carabao.  He walks his carabao past our home most mornings.<p><img src="/images/legacy/3805.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p>Sometimes the carabao graze for a while in the empty lot next to our house. </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3806.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p>James always enjoys seeing them and wanted me to take some pictures!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3807.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p>
