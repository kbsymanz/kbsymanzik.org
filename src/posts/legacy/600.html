<p>Hi,</p><p>I have been more awake today.<br />They took the tube out of my nose <br />but they said they might have to put it back in if I don't eat or drink well.  I'm not sucking really well.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1860.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>I don't like to move the left side of my body either.<br />But I did smile twice at my Mom today.  But she said only the right side of my mouth went up.</p><p>The neurologist, Dr. Soriano, (I like him - he's done all my surgeries)<br />said it looks like I need another shunt.  My right ventricle is not being drained by the shunt on the left side of my head.  Maybe that's why I've been having so many headaches.</p><p>And today I've been crying and rubbing the right side of my head a lot.  It really hurts.</p><p>They did move me into a regular room today.  I hope I can stay here and not have to go back to <span class="caps">ICU</span>.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1861.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Thanks for your prayers for me.  Please keep praying I get better soon.  Pray for my Mom and Dad and my brothers and sisters.<br />Keep my doctors in your prayers too.  I like them and they seem to be doing a good job taking care of me.</p><p>I haven't had any seizures for over 36 hours now!</p><p><em>Psalm 10: 16 The <span class="caps">LORD</span> is king forever and ever;</em>   <em>the nations perish from his land.</em><br /><em>17O <span class="caps">LORD</span>, you hear the desire of the afflicted;</em>   <em>you will strengthen their heart; you will incline your ear</em><br /><em>18to do justice to the fatherless...</em> </p>
