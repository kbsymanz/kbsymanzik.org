<p>Hi,  It's been quite a week.  </p><p>The two boys, James and Jerald came to live with us Saturday night. </p> On Tuesday morning Kurt and Mikayla woke up sick.  We met with the Department of Social Work and Development to begin the foster parent process (<span class="caps">DSWD</span>)...<p>Wednesday Kirsten and Ben joined the 'fun' of being sick with their Daddy and older sister....We also had a home study done by <span class="caps">DSWD</span>.  They have thanked us many times for taking these boys, especially Jerald. If we hadn't he would've ended up in a <span class="caps">DSWD</span> orphanage.  Filipino couples will not adopt 'handicapped' children because of the expense involved in caring for them.</p><p>We took the boys to a doctor for check ups and have a neurosurgeon<br />to go see hopefully today.  He normally has office hours on T and W but his receptionist was going to see if he could see us today.  We are waiting for a text from her.</p><p>The boys are starting to gain weight, have bright eyes, are responding to our voices, and James is starting to get baby fat.<br />Both boys are strong.</p><p>Today Mikayla, Kirsten and Ben feel better but I'm keeping them home from school for one more day of rest. </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/519.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/520.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>More pictures to come soon!!!!!</p>
