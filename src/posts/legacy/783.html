<p>I listened to an excellent message today by John Piper.<br />John Piper states so well what God has been teaching me in our missionary journey these past four plus years.  I urge you to take 35 minutes and listen to this sermon!</p><p>http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/sermons/the-works-of-god-and-the-worship-of-jesus#/listen/full</p><p>The passage he bases his message on is John 9:1-39 where Jesus heals the blind beggar.  His disciples had asked him who had sinned, his parents or the man.<br /><em>"Jesus turns the question around and says, in effect, human causes</em> <em>are not decisive in explaining things. Divine purposes are decisive.</em> <em>Verse 3: "It was not that this man sinned, or his parents</em><br /><em lang="human causes">, but that the works of God might be displayed</em><br /><em>in him [God's purpose]."</em></p><p><em>The reason causes are not the ultimate explanation for things is</em> <em>that God is not ultimately a responder but ultimately a planner. In</em><br /><em>other words, when God ordains that something happen,</em><br /><em>God is not, at the bottom, responding to human causes.</em><br /><em>He is, at bottom, planning a purpose.</em></p><p><strong><em>The implication of this for your life is profound. No matter what</em></strong> <strong><em>mess you're in or what pain you're in, the causes of that mess</em></strong><br /><strong><em>and that pain are not decisive in explaining it. What is decisive in</em></strong> <strong><em>explaining it is God's purpose.</em></strong><br /><em>Yes, there are causes. Some of</em><br /><em>them your fault, perhaps, and some of them not. But those</em><br /><em>causes are not decisive in determining the meaning of your mess</em> <em>or your pain. What is absolutely decisive is God's purpose. "It was</em> <em>not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of</em><br /><em>God might be displayed in him" (verse 3).</em></p><p><em>And if you will confess your sins, and hold fast to Jesus as your</em><br /><em>Rock and your Redeemer and your Riches, God's purpose for</em><br /><em>your mess and your pain will be a good purpose. It will be worth</em> <em>everything you must endure. We know this is true because God</em> <em>says so. Romans 8:28: "And we know that for those who love</em> <br /><em>God all things work together for good, for those who are called</em> <em>according to his purpose."</em></p>
