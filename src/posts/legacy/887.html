<p>One of the many benefits of living in the Philippines are the guys who come around to sharpen knives or fix fans.  No needing to drive somewhere to find a shop.<br />Yesterday, the knife sharpener was on our street.<br />I asked him to sharpen our kitchen knives and our bolo.<br />He saw that the handle of our bolo was not good (it slipped off easily - not good when swinging it back to cut a shrub or something!)<br />So,<br />he fashioned a new handle for us out of two empty 1-liter toyu (soy sauce) bottles that were made of heavier plastic than pop bottles.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2863.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>He used one of the bottles as the core of the handle; melting the</em> <em>plastic over the flame of our propane burners and molding it onto</em> <em>the bolo knife blade.</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2864.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Cutting the plastic melted onto the knife blade</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2865.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Shaping the handle over the heat of flame</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2866.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Cooling the handle in water</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2867.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The finished product!</em></p><p>And isn't that what Jesus does to us?  Puts us in the flame of trials to melt us into Him image; to shape us into His likeness!  Refiner's fire!</p><p>Malachi 3 <em>For he will be like a refiner's fire or a launderer's</em> <em>soap. 3 He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will</em> <em>purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver.</em><br /><em>Then the <span class="caps">LORD</span> will have men who will bring offerings in</em> <em>righteousness,...</em></p><p>1 Peter 1<br /><em>6 In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while</em> <em>you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. 7 These</em> <em>have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith--of</em> <em>greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by</em> <em>fire--may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ</em> <em>is revealed.</em> </p>
