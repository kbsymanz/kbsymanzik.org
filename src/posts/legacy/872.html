<p>Happy New Year to each of you!</p><p>I don't really have a new year resolution other than to......<br /><em>Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law</em><br /><em>that Moses the servant of the <span class="caps">LORD</span> commanded you,</em><br /><em>to love the <span class="caps">LORD</span> your God, and to walk in all his ways and to keep</em><br /><em>his commandments and to cling to him and to serve him with</em><br /><em>all your heart and with all your soul." (Joshua 22:4-6)</em></p><p>Blessings to you!!!!</p><p><em>Hebrews 13:20 - 21</em><br /><em>Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our</em> <em>Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by</em><br /><em>the blood of the eternal covenant,</em><br /><em>equip you with everything good that you may do his will,</em> <br /><em>working in us that which is pleasing in his sight,</em><br /><em>through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</em> </p>
