<p>Our friend, Faith (her English name), recently came over one Saturday morning to teach Mikayla, my friend Rachel, and I how to make KimBop.<br />We started our morning out with a visit to a Korean market to pick up pickled radish, also known as pickled daikon radish (also called danmuji or takuan), bamboo rice roller, seaweed sheets, ham, cucumbers, carrots, sesame oil, Korean salt.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3876.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3877.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" />  </p><p>While the kids played (Rachel's three, Faith's two, and my James),<br />we thinly sliced carrots and sauteed them, thinly sliced cucumbers and soaked them in a mixture of vinegar and sugar and salt, heated up thinly sliced ham, and fried beaten eggs.<br />I had already cooked the rice (3 cups regular white rice and 1 cup sticky rice).<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3878.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3879.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> <br />We then started putting the rolls together.  It was a fun, yummy morning!  <br /><img src="/images/legacy/3880.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3885.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="165" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3884.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="165" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3883.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="165" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3882.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="165" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3881.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="248" /> </p><p>Below is a recipe for Gimbap (Kimbap) from the website<br />http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-gimbap-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-185502</p><p>How To Make Gimbap<br />Makes about 40 pieces<br />What You Need</p><p>Ingredients<br />3 cups warm, cooked short-grain white rice<br />2 tablespoons rice vinegar<br />2 teaspoons sugar<br />1/2 teaspoon sea salt<br />1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds, plus more for garnish<br />5 sheets roasted seaweed (also called gim, nori, or laver)<br />4 to 6 fillings of your choice<br />Toasted sesame oil</p><p>Fillings shown here:<br />5 pencil-size strips pickled daikon radish (also called danmuji or takuan)<br />1 carrot, julienned and sautéed in sesame oil until crisp-tender<br />4 cups spinach, blanched, squeezed, and seasoned with sesame and salt<br />2-egg omelet with sesame oil and salt, cut into pencil-size strips</p><p>Other ideas for fillings:<br />Fresh cucumber, bell pepper, or avocado slices<br />Julienned and sautéed burdock root<br />Sautéed shiitake or portobello mushrooms<br />Kimchi and other pickled vegetables<br />Baked or fried tofu<br />Cooked meat such as beef, ham, imitation crab, or fish cake</p><p>Equipment<br />Bamboo rolling mat<br />Small bowl of warm water<br />Clean cloth or paper towel<br />Pastry brush (optional)<br />Cutting board and sharp chef's knife<br />Instructions</p><p>1. Season the rice. In a small bowl, stir the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until the sugar dissolves. Pour it over the warm rice along with 1 teaspoon of sesame seeds and gently but thoroughly mix together. Let cool.</p><p>2. Organize your workspace. Arrange your ingredients and tools so that everything will be close at hand when needed. Place the bamboo rolling mat on a flat surface with the long side nearest you (the bamboo sticks should be horizontal). Lay out the seaweed sheets, a plate or tray with fillings, and a small bowl of warm water. Also designate a place to put your finished rolls.</p><p>3. Position the seaweed on top of the bamboo mat. With dry hands, place one sheet of seaweed on the bamboo rolling mat with the shiny side down and the long side nearest you.</p><p>4. Spread a layer of rice on top of the seaweed. Lightly moisten your hands with water and evenly spread one-fifth of the rice (about 2/3 cup) on the lower two-thirds of the seaweed, leaving the top third of the seaweed empty. If the rice sticks to your fingers as you work, lightly dip them in water (avoid using too much water as it can make the seaweed soggy).</p><p>5. Arrange the fillings on top of the rice. About an inch up from the bottom of the rice, arrange the fillings in neat, horizontal rows.</p><p>6. Begin rolling. Beginning on the side nearest you, roll the bamboo mat up and over the fillings. Use firm but gentle pressure to hold the ingredients in place.</p><p>7. Continue rolling. As you're rolling forward, pull the mat up and out so it doesn't get caught in the roll. Keep rolling and releasing the mat until you form a compact cylinder.</p><p>8. Seal and season the roll. Dip your finger in water and moisten the edge of the seaweed to seal the roll. Wrap the entire bamboo mat around the roll and give it a firm but gentle squeeze. Using your hands or a pastry brush, lightly coat the outside of the roll with sesame oil to give it shine and prevent it from drying out. Set it aside.</p><p>9. Cut into bite-size pieces. Begin cutting when all the rolls are complete. Using a towel or pastry brush, coat the blade of the knife with a thin layer of sesame oil. Slice the roll into bite-size pieces, periodically wiping the blade and re-applying sesame oil to prevent sticking.</p><p>10. Garnish with sesame seeds (optional). Sprinkle toasted sesame seeds over the cut rolls.</p><p>11. Serve. Serve gimbap at room temperature. Best eaten the same day.</p>
