I simply lose myself in the experience of being alive,                of being in a community of believers,               simply knowing that it's good to be there,              even if I don't know where "there" is or why it's good.</p>    An inner stillness assures me that it is enough right now to be                                    centered,                            to be in Christ Jesus               and that gratefulness is both the heart of living                                  and the                             heart of prayer."<p><em>He makes me lie down in green pastures,</em><br /><em>He leads me beside quiet waters.</em><br /><em>Psalm 23:2</em></p><p><cite>Brennan Manning, "Reflections for Ragamuffins", page 263</cite></p>
