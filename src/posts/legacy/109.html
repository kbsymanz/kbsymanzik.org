<p>Mikayla and Kurt enjoy eating squid.</p><p>So, one day we are at the market and see this big squid.</p><p>"O yum," Mikayla pipes up!  "Can we buy it?"</p><p>So in a moment of temporary insanity on my part we decide to buy it.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/332.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Squid</em></p><p>We bring it home, look up on line how to clean and cook squid,<br />and try it for supper.  Of course, the Mom ends up cleaning this thing!  </p><p>The black oil that comes out of one of those things is amazing!!!!<br />So is the plastic looking spinal thingy!
