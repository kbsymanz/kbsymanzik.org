<p>I have pondered this prayer since my teenage years.  <br />I awoke this morning with it going through my head and thought I'd share it with you all.</p><p><em>"Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.</em><br /><em>Where there is hatred, let me sow love;</em><br /><em>where there is injury,pardon;</em><br /><em>where there is doubt, faith;</em><br /><em>where there is despair, hope;</em><br /><em>where there is darkness, light;</em><br /><em>and where there is sadness, joy.</em></p><p><em>O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek</em><br /><em>to be consoled as to console;</em><br /><em>to be understood as to understand;</em><br /><em>to be loved as to love.</em><br /><em>For it is in giving that we receive;</em><br /><em>it is in pardoning that we are pardoned;</em><br /><em>and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen</em> <br /><em>St. Francis of Assisi</em></p>
