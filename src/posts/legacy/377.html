He is really enjoying the <span class="caps">VBS</span> program.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1104.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1105.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> </p><p>We thank God for the great ministry and outreach this <span class="caps">VBS</span> is, for all the volunteers teaching and assisting, and for God's word being proclaimed in the lives of these kids.</p>
