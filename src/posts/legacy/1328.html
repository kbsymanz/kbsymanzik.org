<p>Last night I had the incredible blessing of being a volunteer at the first ever Night To Shine held here in Davao City.</p><p>Each guest is given a gown or barong to wear, a tiara or crown, a gift bag of items to remember the night.  Each guest had a buddy to help them around - some of the guests were in wheelchairs, on crutches, blind, deaf, downs syndrome....but all so happy to be dancing and dining on great food.</p><p>Night to Shine is an unforgettable prom night experience, centered on God's love, for people with special needs ages 16 and older.<br />It is sponsored by the Tim Tebow Foundation.  What a blessing to dance with these kids and see their happy, joy-filled faces.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4256.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="313" /><br /><em>This girl's joyful exuberance captures the heart of the night and</em><br /><em>the fun the kids had.  Tears were in my eyes often watching and</em><br /><em>interacting with these young adults.  To see their joy and happiness</em><br /><em>is beyond words to express.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/4257.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="449" /><br /><em>This boy loved dancing and the happiness on his face captures</em><br /><em>the heart of the evening...treating these special needs young</em><br /><em>people like kings and queens.  Such a blessing.</em></p><p>Read more about the Tim Tebow Foundation and Night to Shine outreach at https://www.timtebowfoundation.org/index.php/stand-with-night-to-shine/</p>
