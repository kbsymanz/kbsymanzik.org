<p>Well, after four years here, I took the plunge and got my driver's license today.  You need to understand driving here is nothing like <span class="caps">USA</span> driving.<br />When we first moved here it looked so confusing and frustrating; but  there really is a rhythm and rhyme to the flow (or non-flow) of the traffic - - you just need to remember not to be in a hurry going anywhere!!!!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2418.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" /><br />_the waiting area at the <span class="caps">LTO</span> (Land Transportation Office)<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2419.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" /><br /><em>Another angle of the <span class="caps">LTO</span> area.  Thankfully, I was guided through the</em><br /><em>process by a wonderful Filipino colleague who handles government</em><br /><em>document issues for our organization.  The whole process took about</em><br /><em>three hours.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1335.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/1893.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
