<p>Hi!</p><p>Kurt is working on our computer problem.   I have email again!  No pics yet, but that is all coming!  It's handy being married to a computer guy when the technology decides to take a nose dive!!!</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Kurt travels to the US starting Oct. 24 for a computer technical conference in Waxhaw NC at the <span class="caps">JAARS</span> center.  <br />On Nov. 2 he will fly to Detroit and spend 8 days reconnecting with family, supporters, friends.  Obviously, in that short time he won't be able to see everyone,......but next summer we will see as many people as possible while we are back in the states for 8 weeks.</p><p>I've teased him that the kids and I will have wild parties while he's gone!  Actually, we'll miss him and stay busy with daily life activities of school, etc!  </p><p>He will leave from the Detroit airport on Nov 10 and return to Davao Nov. 13.</p><p>Pray for his travel safety, etc....</p>
