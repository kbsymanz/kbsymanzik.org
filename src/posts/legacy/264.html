 Jerard has a tendency to fall asleep very easily, even during his physical therapy exercise.....this makes it very hard to do therapy!!!!  He is not on any anti-siezure medicine so his tiredness is not from that.His physical therapist and us are trying to figure out how to help him stay awake, be alert and get motivated.  Please pray with us for wisdom on how to help him.
