<p>Another poster that came through on Facebook is this.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3422.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="246" /><br />I like the saying.  It is what God wants us to do; He is teaching me more and more to stop trying to be in control and in charge and just let Him be that.  There is a lot of courage in giving up control and allowing God to lead...but it is so much better that way.  He is soverign and all things work out for our good and His glory.</p><p>Like He says in Psalm 37: 6 - 8 <br /><em>6 He will bring forth your righteousness as the light,</em>   <em>and your justice as the noonday.</em></p><p><em>7 Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him;</em>    <em>fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way,</em>    <em>over the man who carries out evil devices!</em></p><p><em>8 Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath!</em>    <em>Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil.</em></p>
