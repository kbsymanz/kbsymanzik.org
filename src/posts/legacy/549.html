I asked him to look at me and he turned his</em><br /><em>head toward the sound of my voice!  That is cause for major</em><br /><em>excitement!</em></p><p>Psalm 20:7Some trust in chariots and some in horses,    but we trust in the name of the <span class="caps">LORD</span> our God.<br />8They collapse and fall,  <strong>but we rise and stand upright.</strong></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1752.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerard's chariot!</em></p><p>I hired a local carpenter that had been recommended to us to build a standing table for Jerard.  I showed him a picture of a standing table from the "Disabled Village Children" book and he made this for Jerard. He delivered it yesterday evening.</p>
