<p>Recently Anne and Bob Owens from "Barnabas International" were here to encourage the <span class="caps">SIL</span> mission community here in Davao.</p><p>To find out more about 'Barnabas International' go to their website:    http://www.barnabas.org/<br />"Welcome to Barnabas International!<br />Providing pastoral care to missionaries, MKs, global servants and their families."</p><p>One of the events we hosted was a women's supper at our house.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1039.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1041.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>God has blessed us with a house able to hold many visitors.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1040.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Anne Owens</em></p><p>After a pot-luck dinner, Anne shared an encouraging message about how God orchestrates our lives for His glory and our good; and how encouraging it can be to others to share what God has done in our lives.  After she spoke, there was a time for some of the women to share some of what God has done or is doing in their lives.  It was a wonderful evening.</p><p>1 Thess. 5:11<br /><em>Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just</em> <em>as in fact you are doing.</em></p><p>Heb. 3:13<br /><em>But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today,</em></p>
