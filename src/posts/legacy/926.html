<p>James has a very tender heart towards prayer.<br />The other night Mikayla and I were sitting on the couch talking. <br />James sits down on the couch too and asks us to please be quiet, he needs to have his quiet time. Then he folds his hands together and starts thanking Jesus for His blessings.....melt my momma's heart!!!!!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2985.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James praying on our bed.</em></p>
