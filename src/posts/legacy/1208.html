<p>The Middle schoolers recently had a band concert.<br />!<img src="/images/legacy/3809.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p><p>Ben is playing trumpet and really enjoys this instrument.  He<br />sounds really good and had a solo in one of the musical selections played! (Proud mama talking!!)<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3810.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /><br />The concert was very nice.  I'm so thankful for the band director here at Faith Academy Davao.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3811.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /><br /><em>I have a hard time shooting a clear photo of him back on stage</em></p><p>James and a couple of his buddies had fun playing with each other before the concert started!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3808.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="248" /></p>
