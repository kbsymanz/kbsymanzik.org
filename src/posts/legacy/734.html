<p>James recently received a "Hermie and Friends" vcd entitled "Flo the Lyin' Fly."  He absolutely loves this show and watches it numerous times on a daily basis!  It's a kids cartoon about telling the truth and not teasing people.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2344.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></p><p>One of James' favourite lunches to have is scrambled eggs and rice.<br />Today he requested I make some eggs and rice for him, so I said I would.  But his Lola, our helper, Arlene, teased him and said, "we have no eggs, James!"<br />As the Hermie video was playing in the background he says to her "Don't tell a lie, Lola!"  We all cracked up laughing!  The message is sinking in to him from this excellent Max Lucado video series for kids.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2147.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="217" /></p><p><em>Colossians 3: 9 - 10</em><br /><em>Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the</em><br /><em>old self with its practices 10and have put on the new self,</em><br /><em>which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of</em><br /><em>its creator.</em></p><p><em>Proverbs 30:8</em><br /><em>Remove far from me falsehood and lying;...</em></p>
