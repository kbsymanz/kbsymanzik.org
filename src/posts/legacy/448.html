<p>Many have been asking how Jerard is doing.  </p><p>Jerard enjoys music, tickles, being talked to.  He is a blessing.<br />His favourite foods are pancakes, pasta, graham crackers and sweets (cookies, ice cream, etc.)</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1379.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerard</em></p><p>He is slowly making some progress.  He receives occupational therapy twice a week at Resources for the Blind here in Davao.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1361.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerard really enjoys his OT at Resources for the Blind</em></p><p>He recently had a one year check up with the neurologist.  The Dr. was very pleased with the progress Jerard has made.  But he does want us to take him to a rehabilitation orthopedic doctor towards the end of September  to see if he needs braces for his legs. </p><p>He likes to put everything in his mouth.  When we are holding him we have to be careful he doesn't bite.  His bites are painful.</p><p>Keep him in your prayers.  He doesn't sit up on his own or crawl yet.  Overall he is staying healthy, though he does have asthma he receives daily medications for.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1380.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerard enjoying the grass at the soccer field.</em></p>
