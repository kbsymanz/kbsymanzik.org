<p>I've been working on a talk I'll be giving next week and while reading Psalm 51:7 I wondered what a 'hyssop' is.</p><p>This is what I discovered....<br /><em>"Purge me with hyssop," the Bible records, "and I will be clean."</em> </p><p><em>Hyssop has been used for millennia as a holy herb, consecrated</em><br /><em>for cleaning holy places. Its name comes from the Hebrew word</em><br /><em>adobe or ezob, which literally means*"holy herb"*.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3640.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="133" /></p> <em>Hyssop is an evergreen bushy herb growing 1 to 2 feet</em><em>(60 to 90 cm) high on a square stem with linear leaves and</em><em>flowers in whorls of 6 to 15 blooms.  Native to southern Europe,</em><em>it is grown in gardens in cooler climates around the world.</em><em>Hyssop has a mint-like taste (which is understandable as it is</em><em>part of the mint family) that makes it a tasty addition to salads,</em> <em>provided it is used in small quantities. It has been considered an</em><em>aphrodisiac when combined with ginger, thyme, and pepper.</em> <em>Hyssop has been hung in homes to provide protection from the</em><em>evil eye, and from witches. It has also been planted frequently</em><em>on graves as protection for the dead from the living.</em><p><em>information from the website http://www.mountainroseherbs.</em><br /><em>com/learn/hyssop.php</em></p>
