<p>Hi, please pray our trip back to Davao goes well.  Mikayla went to bed last night with a fever and sore throat.  I am praying she is well today before we board the plane at 5:30p;  (which is 6:30a Friday morning Davao time).<br />We are looking forward to seeing James and Jerard again very soon!</p>
