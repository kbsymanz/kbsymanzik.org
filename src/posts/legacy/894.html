<p>As many of you know, Kurt is in the <span class="caps">USA</span>.  He'd gone for some meetings in North Carolina but is now in Michigan visiting relatives, friends and supporters.<br />While there, he has sent me two photos of the day his brother and our niece took him out snowboarding!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2904.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="299" /><br /><em>Kurt snowboarding for the first time in his life!</em><br /><img src="/images/legacy/2905.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="299" /><br /><em>Hannah and Kurt!  They only went down the hill twice because then</em><br /><em>Hannah fell and broke her arm!  <span class="caps">HUGS</span> to you, Hannah!!!!</em></p>
