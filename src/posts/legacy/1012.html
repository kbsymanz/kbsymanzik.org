<p>Thanksgiving holiday is coming up on November 22 for <span class="caps">USA</span> citizens.<br />In the <span class="caps">USA</span> turkeys are plentiful and not very expensive.  Here it is a different story.  A turkey or two will start showing up in some of the grocery store freezers towards the end of October.<br />Yesterday I purchased a frozen turkey that was around 13 pounds (6 kilos).  Turkey for our family here in the Philippines is a once a year treat.  It costs around $3.50 per pound!<br />Our turkey is in the freezer and will be cooked on November 22.  We have invited a few friends over to share our Thanksgiving meal.<br />We will also be sharing our thanks to God for His abundant blessings, mercies and graces in our lives.</p><p>James is memorizing Psalm 118:1 "Give thanks to the Lord for He is good, for his steadfast love endures forever."</p><p>A great verse to know and meditate on.</p><p>Thankful for family, friends, turkey and much more!!!!</p>
