<p>Our son, Ben, turned 9 years old today!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1938.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben</em></p><p>He woke up this morning with croup and was not feeling well so his original birthday plans had to be delayed.<br />His Daddy took him to the mall this afternoon to play at the arcade and watch a movie.  They had good 'father-son' time.<br />This evening, two of Ben's friends, Joel and Michael, came for dinner and play time!  They all greatly enjoyed the punching bag Ben received.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1935.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Joel, Ben, and Michael</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1936.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben enjoying the punching bag for practicing his karate he</em><br /><em>received for his birthday.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1937.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>'Balloon Warriors' - Joel, Ben, Michael</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1939.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Impressive kick, Ben!</em></p><p>We thank God for Ben and the blessing he is.</p><p><em>Help him always seek first You and Your kingdom.  Make him a</em> <em>man after Your own heart.  Thank you for blessing us with him</em> <em>as our son.  Amen.</em></p><p>Proverbs 4: 20My son, be attentive to my words;   incline your ear to my sayings.<br />21 Let them not escape from your sight;    keep them within your heart.<br />22For they are life to those who find them,   and healing to all their flesh.</p>
