<p>Please pray for Mikayla's foot.  Her foot was scraped this past weekend while on an outing and became very swollen, red, hot and painful.  She was running a fever on Sunday as well.  Now she is on antibiotics and the redness is diminishing.  Her foot is still swollen and aches a lot.  She did not go to school Monday because of it.  Today (Tuesday our time) she doesn't have school since it is a national holiday here.  Thanks.</p>
