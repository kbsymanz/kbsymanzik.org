<p>Mikayla, Kirsten, and Ben's school had a year end ceremony on Friday May 23.<br />It was a very nice ceremony honoring parent volunteers, teachers that are leaving, and 8th grade graduates.<br />Flags from all the countries represented at the school were marched in by the 6th and 7th grades; then the elementary kids sang the Philippine National Anthem.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/670.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/671.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/665.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>The kindergarten class sang a praise song they have been learning and the middle school 6th and 7th graders sang a couple very nice songs that sounded great.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/667.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/666.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/668.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/669.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Then the 8th graders were given certificates of moving up into high school.  Each of the 8th graders shared a short speech about school high lights, people they are thankful for in their lives, and a Bible verse that holds special meaning to them.  Then there was a power point presentation with photos of each of the 8th graders from their younger years.</p><p>Next year it will be Mikayla's turn to participate in the 8th grade graduation ceremony!</p><p>This week the kids are wrapping up their school year.  The K - 3rd graders are heading to the beach Wednesday, 4th and 5th graders on Thursday.  Class parties are planned.  </p><p>Our kids are looking forward to summer break.</p><p>We plan to focus on language learning a bit more intensely this summer as a family, along with trips to the beach, a vacation, etc...</p>
