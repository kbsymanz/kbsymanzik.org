<p>Well, James has been complaining that he can't see well so I took him an eye exam and sure enough, he needs glasses.  We got those today.  He looks great in them.  Now if only I had a camara that worked so I could take a picture to post here!!!!!  I think I'll be asking for that for Christmas!!!  :)</p>
