<p>Jerard came home from the hospital today. </p><p>He has an IV antibiotic he's on as a precaution.  That will be administered three times a day through a heparin lock until Wednesday. </p><p>The doctor is pleased with how the shunt seems to be working.<br />Pray no infection sets in!</p><p>His blood work has been improving, his cerebral spinal fluid is 'clean' and at this moment no infection seems to be anywhere!</p> It is nice to have a short hospital stay and it is nicer still to have him home!<p>We did get the results of the immunoassay test he had a while ago.  While some antibodies are low there is no cause for concern.  <br />It could be his body just working on getting better.  <br />The immunoassay test will be repeated in a couple weeks to see if his antibodies are getting stronger.  <br />Pray they are!!!</p>
