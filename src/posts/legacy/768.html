<p><em>Matthew 19: 13 - 14</em><br /><em>Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on</em> <em>them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people, 14but Jesus said,</em> <em>"Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them,</em><br /><em>for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2469.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p><p>This morning James and I were reviewing his catechism.<br />James asked me,  "Where is God?"  I told him God is everywhere.<br />Then he asked, "Where is Jesus?"  I said Jesus could live in his heart if he asked Him in.   James said, "I want Jesus in my heart."<br />So we prayed and James asked Jesus to come live in his heart.<br />After we prayed James clapped his hands, smiled real big and said "Jesus is in my heart!"  I clapped with him and told him that the angels in heaven are rejoicing that he accepted Christ as his Lord and Saviour.</p><p><em>Luke 15: 7-8</em><br /><em>Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner</em> <em>who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need</em><br /><em>no repentance.</em></p><p>I am thanking God for hearing my prayers that each of my children would accept Christ at a young age.  They each have and God has blessed me with being able to pray the sinners prayer of repentance with each of them.</p><p><em>3 John 1:4I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are</em> <em>walking in the truth.</em></p><p><em>1 John 3: 1See what kind of love the Father has given to us,</em><br /><em>that we should be called children of God; and so we are.</em><br /><em>The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not</em><br /><em>know him. 2Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we</em><br /><em>will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he</em> <br /><em>appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.</em></p>
