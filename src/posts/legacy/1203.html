<p>I've been reading "A Quest for Godliness" by J.I. Packer.  This book explores deeply the Puritan spiritual life.  J.I. Packer introduces the teachings of great Puritan leaders such as John Owen, Richard Baxter, and Jonathon Edwards.<br />He also looks at the Puritan view of the Bible, family life, the Sabbath, worship, etc.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3803.jpg" alt="" width="231" height="346" /></p><p>This book has really piqued my interest in the reformation literature.</p><p>Some of the literature I am currently looking at are<br />Richard Baxter's Christian Directory, available at chrome://epubreader/content/reader.xul?id=11.</p><p>Westminster shorter catechism and sermons from reformed pastors.  See http://www.westminsterconfession.org/literature/</p><p>and Thomas Chalmers "Self Examination" writing - see http://www.westminsterconfession.org/the-doctrines-of-grace/essay-on-guthries-the-christians-great-interest.php</p><p>I encourage you to read J.I.Packer's book and/or read the articles available at the above websites.</p>
