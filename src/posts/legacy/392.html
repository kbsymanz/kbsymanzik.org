<p>We are leaving today (Saturday May 23) at 3:15p.m. local time.<br />I probably won't be posting another blog until Monday or Tuesday.</p><p>Thank God for answered prayer!  <br />Our paperwork arrived on Friday around noon!  <br />Kurt woke up this morning fever-free; still a bit sore but yeah for fever free!</p><p>Please pray for our kids - Mikayla had to say good-bye to three friends who are moving away and won't be back for 9th grade or probably ever, and is a bit sad today about all that.<br />Pray for safe travels for us.</p><p>We are so looking forward to seeing family and friends again soon!</p><p>Arlene, James, and Jerard are all set up to stay here while we are gone.  What a blessing our voice pulse phone is as it will be a local call from where we are staying to here to talk with our guys and Arlene.</p><p>Prayerfully, in another two years we can come back to the states with James and Jerard, once the adoption is finalized!</p><p>See some of you soon!!!<br />Thanks for your prayers!</p>
