<p>We are back!  </p><p>The air flights were turbulent.</p><p>When we arrived in Davao Ben was stopped at quarrintine due to a slightly elevated fever.  (99F),  He and Kurt had to go to a local hospital for a throat swab to see if its that H1N1 flu.  So as I blog this I have no news on what the dr. at the hospital is saying Ben has.<br />As a Mom I can tell you that Ben has a bad case of being overly tired from 2 days of travel and not sleeping well on the plane and all he really needs is to come home and sleep.</p><p>Pray for us.  We are glad to be back.  It is so good to see James and Jerard.  James clapped when he saw us at the gate.</p><p>We are also tired and this having to take Ben to ER for a slightly elevated temp seems a bit over kill to me.....</p><p>After a good night's sleep things will look much better.</p>
