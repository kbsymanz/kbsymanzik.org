Run in such a way as to get the prize. 25 Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. 26 Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air. 27 No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3468.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3469.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /><br /><img src="/images/legacy/3470.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p>
