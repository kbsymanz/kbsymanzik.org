<p>Need a fresh Christian perspective on sharing the gospel with Muslims?  Want to understand a little more about how Muslims think and what they value?  Then maybe the book, "The Crescent Through the Eyes of the Cross: Insights from an Arab Christian" is for you.</p><p>I just finished the book myself and I appreciate the perspective that I gained from this Arab Christian who has spent his life grappling with the issue of loving and communicating the gospel to Muslims.  </p><p>Here in the Philippines, especially in the south, there is a significant Muslim population.  There are communities of Muslims that live closer than a mile from our house.  I have friends that minister to Muslims groups in this part of the country.</p><p>Yet, I have also found that many Christians, both Filipino and non-Filipino, are frightened or at least wary of their Muslims neighbors.  And I suspect that the same holds true for the other direction: Muslims are suspicious of Christians as well.</p><p>Well, I don't want to continue like that.  While I cannot change the attitude of anyone else, I can change my attitude.  This book has helped me a lot.</p><p>It is Ramadan right now, the time of fasting and prayer for Muslims around the world.  Maybe we as Christians should do a little soul searching as well during this time?  I know other Christians think this way as well.
