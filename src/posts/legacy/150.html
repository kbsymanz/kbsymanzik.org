<p>Ben has a very tender heart to the things of God.  He thinks often of heaven and what heaven will be like when we get there.</p><p>This morning he announced to me, "Mom, I want to die when I'm a kid so I can go to Heaven."  <br />"Why is that, honey?"  I asked.<br />"I want to play with cool toys and play with God!"<br />"That would be neat to play with God, wouldn't it!?"<br />"Yes."</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/497.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>A month ago Ben rededicated his life to Christ as his personal Lord and Saviour.  He had accepted Jesus as his Lord and Saviour  when he was three but didn't remember the event so he asked to pray again 'now that I'm 6 so I'll remember.  I love Jesus so much.'  </p><p>Since then he has been asking more and more questions about eternal life, how to love Jesus in this life, and what heaven will be like.  </p><p>(I really enjoy our night time routine of reading the Bible, studying the catechism, and praying together.  He is a sweet boy and I thank God for him. We have many good talks together at bedtime.)</p><p>Cheri Keagy's song "Heaven's On My Mind" has been playing through my head all day since this morning's conversation with Ben.....</p><p>"If you see the light<br />Inside my eyes<br />I can't contain this inner peace<br />It's welling up inside of me<br />If you knew Him then you'd agree<br />And love Him too<br />Just the way I do</p><p>So glad to know<br />I'm gonna see my God in heaven<br />So good to be assured of my home<br />And if you need to know<br />The reason why I shine<br />It's because heaven, heaven's on my mind<br />Heaven's on my mind ........."</p><p>3 John 1:4  I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.</p><p>Matthew 19: 14  Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/495.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
