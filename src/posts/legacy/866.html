<p>Please pray for all the people affected by this flooding....Thanks.<br />This did not occur in Davao where we live but in towns several hours here on the island of Mindanao.</p><p>http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/18/death-toll-from-philippine-storm-reaches-569-hundreds-missing/?iref=allsearch<br />from <span class="caps">CNN</span> website:<br />Death toll from Philippine storm reaches 548; hundreds missing<br />December 18th, 2011</p><p>Devastation from a tropical storm that deluged the southern Philippines mounted on Sunday, with the death toll rising to 548, military officials said.<br />About 370 people are missing, the Philippine Red Cross said, after entire villages were swept away. The agency offered a different death toll than the military - 532 - but it was not clear why.<br />The stench of death permeated the air as aid workers scrambled to help survivors.<br />The vast majority of the dead were found in the port cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro, according to military and disaster officials. Water-logged bodies from washed-away villages floated at the shoreline, on the northwestern coast of Mindanao island.<br />Five people were killed in a landslide, but virtually all others died in flash flooding after Tropical Storm Washi, which is called Sendong locally.<br />Survivors in the hardest-hit areas now contend with no electricity and a lack of clean drinking water. One woman in Cagayan de Oro collected murky brown floodwater in a bucket, just meters away from where a destroyed vehicle was submerged.<br />Flash flooding overnight Friday - following 10 hours of rain - fueled the devastation. As much as 20 centimeters (8 inches) of rain fell within 24 hours in some areas.</p>
