<p>What hit me first was the overwhelming smell of....., yep, you guessed it....grass....when I opened the can.......<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2314.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>whew.....</p><p>then I tried some straight out of the can.....yep....tastes like grass with bitterness thrown in......<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2315.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>so I made a syrup recommended for grass jelly - 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water; mixed in a can of lychees and a can of fruit cocktail.....chilled it real well.......</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2316.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></p><p>and the verdict is...........................................</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2317.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kurt really liked it</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2318.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Mikayla really liked it</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2319.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James really liked it</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2322.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerard and I really liked it</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2323.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Jerard eating more of it</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2321.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben tolerated it but since he isn't a fan of fruit cocktail or lychees,</em><br /><em>it didn't strike him as something he'd like again.</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2320.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Kirsten didn't like it at all but not so much because of the taste,</em><br /><em>but because of the texture.</em></p><p>The grass jelly, when mixed with the fruit and syrup, had no taste of it's own like it had in the can.  I'd buy it again.  Next time I'll try the mango, whipped cream and grass jelly mix that is another recommended way to eat grass jelly.  (check out http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/368051 if you ever buy a can of grass jelly.  In the US you'd probably find it at an Asian food store or in the Asian section at the grocery store.)</p>
