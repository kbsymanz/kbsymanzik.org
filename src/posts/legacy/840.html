<p><img src="/images/legacy/2743.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p><p>My Grandma Annie would be around 127 years old today if she was still alive!<br />She lived with my family when I was growing up from the time I was 5 until I was 16 when she died at the age of 94.  <br />She was wheel-chair-bound all those years due to a fractured thigh bone that never did heal right.<br />But she didn't let that dampen her spirits.  She ironed clothes, helped make dinner, taught me to make pie crusts and how to bake bread. She also taught me to crochet.<br />She loved to listen to Paul Harvey "and now, the rest of the story."<br />She was a firm believer in the benefits of gargling with listerine daily.<br />She was a prayer warrior and knew her Bible well.  If you wondered where something was in the Bible, she usually knew.<br />She used to tell me stories about her growing up years; life in Chicago and her time in an orphanage.  She'd talk about her dad and sister.  My Grandma had a wonderful laugh and she liked fun.  She was a special lady and a person who meant a lot to me in my growing up years.  I'm thankful for her and her example.</p><p>Psalm 71: 17 - 19<br /><em>17 Since my youth, God, you have taught me,</em></p><p><em>and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.</em><br /><em>18 Even when I am old and gray,</em>   <em>do not forsake me, my God,</em><br /><em>till I declare your power to the next generation,</em>   <em>your mighty acts to all who are to come.</em></p> <em>19 Your righteousness, God, reaches to the heavens,</em>   <em>you who have done great things.</em>   <em>Who is like you, God?</em>
