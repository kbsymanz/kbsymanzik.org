<p>James' rash is cleared up and his high fevers are gone.<br />He still has days where he has a low-grade fever and doesn't have much energy.  Today has been one of those days for him.  Lying around and being held have been what he really wants to do today.<br />Dengue can take weeks to fully recover from, so please keep him in your prayers.   Thanks!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1618.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>James with his two favourite stuffed animals - Tigger and</em><br /><em>Curious George.
