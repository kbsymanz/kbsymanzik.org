<p>James is fond of saying, "That's my Lola" whenever he sees any pictures of Arlene.  </p><p><img src="/images/legacy/2147.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="217" /></p><p>Arlene is our helper and friend who has helped care for James and Jerard since we got them.  <br />She is the one who stayed with the boys when we were back in the states two years ago.  She also stays at our house with Jerard when we go away.<br />She is a wonderful Christian person and we are so blessed to have her as a helper and friend!</p>
