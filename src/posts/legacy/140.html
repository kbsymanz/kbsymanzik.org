<p>The kids had Friday off so we decided to start baking Christmas cookies.  We turned on Christmas carol CD music and made roll out and chocolate chip.</p><p>We need to make lots as we've been told many carolers come to the door during the holiday season.  We plan to pass out cookies!</p><p>Ben really enjoyed helping crack eggs and mix the flour in by hand.  We made a friend's recipe that makes like 10 - 12 dozen cookies!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/445.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Kirsten really enjoyed rolling out sugar cookies.  She was glad we had a Michigan cookie cutter to make some Michigan cookies.  She misses her cousins and friends,.....more so now with the holidays coming.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/446.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Kirsten and Ben rolling out cookies.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/447.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Our good friend, Beth, helping the kids frost cookies!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/448.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>Some of the finished product.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/449.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
