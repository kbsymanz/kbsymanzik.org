<p>The other morning I woke Ben up to have him shower and get ready for the day's events.  After about 10 minutes I realized I did not hear him showering so I knocked on the bathroom door.  When I got no reply I opened the door to find that he had fallen asleep on the bathroom floor!!!!!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1204.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p>(Yes, our schedule has been busy and enjoyable, but this week we are trying to get some 'down time' in as we have all been feeling very tired!!!)</p>
