<p>"Christmas is the promise that the God who came in history and comes daily in mystery will one day come in glory.<br />God is saying in Jesus that in the end everything will be all right.<br />Nothing can harm you permanently, no suffering is irrevocable, no loss is lasting, no defeat is more than transitory, no disappointment is conclusive.<br />Jesus did not deny the reality of suffering, discouragement, disappointment, frustration, and death; <br />he simply stated that the Kingdom of God would conquer all these horrors,<br />that the Father's love is so prodigal that no evil could possibly resist it."</p><p><em>He will wipe every tear from their eyes.</em><br /><em>There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain,</em><br /><em>for the old order of things has passed away.</em><br />Revelation 21:4</p><p>-from "Reflections for Ragamuffins" by Brennan Manning; 1998.</p>
