<p>The other morning as I was in the kitchen making coffee at 4:45a  I kept hearing a 'scritch-scritch' sound coming from under the dirty dishes in the kitchen sink.  I figured it was a bug of some sort and went on with my morning routine.  Later on I discovered it was one of these..............<br /><img src="/images/legacy/41.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>a rhinoceros beetle</em></p><p>This is the second time I can recall finding one in our kitchen sink.  Honestly,  I prefer these to cockroaches any day  (which I have found far more often in our sink but thankfully not to often!!!)!!!! </p>
