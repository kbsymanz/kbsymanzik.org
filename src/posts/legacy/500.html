<p>"Welcome to Hotel Bethlehem...." the exuberant elementary kids sang at last night's performance of Hotel Bethlehem.  It was a wonderful show and a clear presentation of the real reason we celebrate Christmas.</p><p>The choir director did an excellent job working with the kids to learn all their songs and motions.</p><p>I had the fun and privilege of being 'costume manager'!  I truly enjoyed doing that!</p><p>Ben had a great time singing in the choir, too!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1595.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>pinning up costumes</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1596.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>making sure kids look good for the show!</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1597.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1598.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Ben enthusiastically singing and doing the motions for the songs</em></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1599.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>The K - 4th graders</em></p><p>The choir ended the show with a rousing performance of "Jesus, Jesus, Oh What A Wonderful Child."  A clear invitation to accept Christ as Saviour was presented.  As I watched and listened I thanked God for all the teachers at Faith Academy, for the privilege our kids have to attend here, and for being able to be in a school that can clearly present the gospel and real reason for Christmas.</p><p>"Jesus, Jesus<br />Oh what a wonderful child<br />Jesus, Jesus<br />So lowly meek and mild<br />New life, new hope, new joy He brings<br />Won't you listen to the angels sing<br />Glory, glory, glory<br />To the new born King"</p><p>Isaiah 9:6-7<br /><em>6For to us a child is born,</em>  <em>to us a son is given;</em> <em>and the government shall be upon his shoulder,</em>   <em>and his name shall be called</em><br /><em>Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,</em>  <em>Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</em><br /><em>7Of the increase of his government and of peace</em>  <em>there will be no end,</em><br /><em>on the throne of David and over his kingdom,</em>  <em>to establish it and to uphold it</em><br /><em>with justice and with righteousness</em>  <em>from this time forth and forevermore.</em><br /><em>The zeal of the <span class="caps">LORD</span> of hosts will do this.</em></p>
