<p>There have been many events the since December here making trials the path we are walking on at the moment.  We are not at liberty to share to many details but appreciate your ongoing prayers for us.</p><p>Recently I purchased this decoration from a street vendor as a visual reminder of this truth:  Jesus is the anchor of my soul.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3433.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /></p><p>As it says in Hebrews 6:18<br /><em>18 so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is</em><br /><em>impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge</em><br /><em>might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the</em><br /><em>hope set before us. 19 We have this as a sure and steadfast</em> <strong><em>anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place</em></strong><br /><em>behind the curtain, 20 where Jesus has gone as a forerunner</em><br /><em>on our behalf,...</em></p><p>The anchor also reminds me of one of my favourite hymns - <strong>He Leadeth Me......</strong></p><p><em>He leadeth me:  O blessed thought!</em>  <em>O words with heavenly comfort fraught!</em>  <em>Whate'er I do, where'er I be,</em> <em>still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.</em>  </p><p><em>Refrain:</em><em>He leadeth me, he leadeth me,</em> <em>by his own hand he leadeth me;</em> <em>his faithful follower I would be,</em> <em>for by his hand he leadeth me.</em></p><p><em>Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom,</em> <em>sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,</em> <em>by waters still, o'er troubled sea,</em> <em>still 'tis his hand that leadeth me.</em>  <em>(Refrain)</em></p><p><em>Lord, I would place my hand in thine,</em> <em>nor ever murmur nor repine;</em> <em>content, whatever lot I see,</em> <em>since 'tis my God that leadeth me.</em>  <em>(Refrain)</em></p><p><em>And when my task on earth is done,</em> <em>when by thy grace the victory's won,</em> <em>e'en death's cold wave I will not flee,</em> <em>since God through Jordan leadeth me.</em>  <em>(Refrain)</em></p>
