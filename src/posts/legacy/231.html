<p>Every year the Middle School has a banquet for the 6 - 8th graders.<br />This year's banquet was at a local restaraunt.  The kids dress up nice, have a nice meal, play some games, and enjoy an 'end-of-shcool-year-party' with their teachers.</p><p>Mikayla and her friends had a great time leading up to the banquet shopping for dresses and shoes.  Finding dressy size 9.5 women's shoes here is quite a feat, but we accomplished it!!!! (Most shoe stores carry up to size 7 or 8 womens).<br />One of the teachers did Mikayla's hair the day of the banquet. </p><p>Mikayla had a great time at the banquet.  She is growing into a fine young lady and I thank God for her!</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/659.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/660.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/661.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
