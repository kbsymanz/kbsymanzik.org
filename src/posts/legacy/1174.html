<p>Ecclesiastes 3 states  <em>For everything there is a season,</em><br /><em>and a time for every matter under heaven:</em></p><p><em>a time to be born, and a time to die;</em><br /><em>a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;</em><br /><em>a time to kill, and a time to heal;</em><br /><em>a time to break down, and a time to build up;</em><br /><em>a time to weep, and a time to laugh;</em><br /><em>a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</em><br /><em>a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones</em> <em>together;</em><br /><em>a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</em><br /><em>a time to seek, and a time to lose;</em><br /><em>a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</em><br /><em>a time to tear, and a time to sew;</em><br /><em>a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</em><br /><em>a time to love, and a time to hate;</em><br /><em>a time for war, and a time for peace.</em></p><p>Recently, I read some thoughts by George Carlin, a comedian from the 1970's and 80's that states succinctly what I was pondering while in the <span class="caps">USA</span>.  Many times people asked me what I enjoyed about life in the Philippines and I'd reply, "the slower pace of life and the importance and focus on relationships over getting something done."<br />Over the years here in the Philippines I have learned to slow down, walk in more patience and rest, trusting my Saviour that all will happen in His timing, His way.  I also cherish my relationships with family and friends so much more.<br />This writing by George Carlin is lengthy but well worth the reading.</p><p>May this new year find each of us slowing down to enjoy our loved ones more, to focus on our relationships with each other and with Christ, and to walk in His way, knowing that He has a time for everything that occurs.</p><p><strong><span class="caps">SOMETHING</span> TO PONDER: George Carlin</strong> </p><p>The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, <br />wider Freeways, but narrower viewpoints. <br />We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. <br />We have bigger houses and smaller families, <br />more conveniences, but less time. <br />We have more degrees but less sense, <br />more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, <br />more medicine, but less wellness. <br />We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. <br />We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. <br />We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often..... <br />We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. <br />We've added years to life not life to years. <br />We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. <br />We conquered outer space but not inner space. <br />We've done larger things, but not better things. <br />We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. <br />We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. <br />We write more, but learn less. <br />We plan more, but accomplish less. <br />We've learned to rush, but not to wait. <br />We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less. <br />These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, <br />big men and small character, <br />steep profits and shallow relationships. <br />These are the days of two incomes but more divorce; fancier houses, but broken homes. <br />These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. <br />It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. <br />A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete. <br /><em>Remember to spend some time with your loved ones, because</em> <em>they are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind</em> <em>word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little</em> <em>person soon will grow up and leave your side.</em> <br /><em>Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because</em> <em>that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it</em> <em>doesn't cost a cent.</em> <br /><em>Remember, to say, 'I love you' to your partner and your loved</em> <em>ones, but most of all mean it.</em> <br /><em>A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep</em> <em>inside of you.</em> <br /><em>Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday</em> <em>that person will not be there again.</em> <br /><em>Give time to love, give time to speak! And give time to share</em> <em>the precious thoughts in your mind.</em><br /><em>And always remember, life is not</em><br /><em>measured by the number of breaths we take, but by those</em> <em>moments that take our breath away.</em> <br />George Carlin</p>
