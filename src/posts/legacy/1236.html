<p>I have had the privilege and fun of teaching a creative writing exploratory to six middle school students this first quarter of the school year.<br />I've been encouraging the students to recognize that creativity is a God-given talent we should all be developing.  God, our Father, is a creative God.  He doesn't want us hiding our talents under a bushel!  Developing a creative life style entails noticing nature, shapes, colours, people. Each person we meet is created in the image of God by God Himself.  Amazing thought.</p><p>The students have been doing creative writing exercises and are now working on putting together a book of short stories inspired from the various creative writing exercises they've been working on.<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3908.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="250" /> <br />Living a creative life is not just about being "an artist." It's about going after your dreams, whatever they are, living authentically, living emotionally healthy spirituality, facing fears and self-doubt  and stepping forward in spite of them.<br />Living creatively and authentically means allowing yourself to be imperfect, allowing yourself to play, to be a beginner.  I've really been encouraging my students to spend 10 - 20 minutes a day writing.  Rather than saying "someday I'll write a book", if you start writing 10 - 20 minutes a day then you are working on your goal instead of just wishfully thinking about something.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3909.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="246" /> </p>
