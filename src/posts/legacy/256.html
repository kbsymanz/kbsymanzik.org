<p>Jerard was seen by a physical therapist today at "Resources for the Blind" for an evaluation.<br />He will start physical therapy (p.t.) next week three times a week to help him gain motor skills.<br />We were very pleased with the therapist and the facilities!  <br />Check out their website: http://www.blind.org.ph/admins/contactus.html</p>
