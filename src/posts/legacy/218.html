<p>We were pleasantly surprised Saturday morning when the doctor came in and said Jerard could go home with a heparin lock to continue the IV medicine through this coming Friday.</p><p>He was seen by an immunologist the day before discharge. <br />The doctors are wondering why, when he gets one illness such as a urinary tract infection, his whole body becomes ill and he ends up with meningitis or sepsis or ventricleitis.<br />He will have blood work done on Wednesday for an immunoassay test.  The blood will be sent to Manila for testing and we will receive the results in 3 - 5 weeks after testing.</p><p>At this time, the one shunt in Jerard's head seems to be handling the draining of the ventricles.  He is on a medicine that decreases the amount of cerebral fluid being made so when that is discontinued in a few days, then we and the doctors will have a clearer idea if the one shunt is handling everything or not.  He will be closely monitored by the doctors for the next 3 - 4 weeks.</p><p>If the one shunt is not handling all the drainage then there would be a need to put in a second shunt.</p><p>So tomorrow I will blog about the activities of our other kids.</p><p>Keep us in your prayers.  It is really nice to be out of the hospital.<br />Jerard has spend 49 days of his young life in the hospital so far.</p>
