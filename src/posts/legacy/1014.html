<p>Dear friends,</p> Pastor Ian and Nen are part of  Reach Int'l Team here in the Philippines and they have been dear friends and workers for Dr. Sam and Sherri for many years.  Dr. Sam and Sherri are dear friends of ours.  We appreciate Dr. Sam's friendship and medical expertice.

There were complications with the birthing process and the baby was oxygen deprived for at least 5 - 10 minutes.  There appears to be some neurological problems with their 7 day old newborn baby who remains in <span class="caps">ICU</span> at a local hospital here. The neurologist is still running tests.</p><p>Please pray for Ian and Nen - for finances to cover the hospital costs; please <span class="caps">PRAY</span> for baby Gabrielle, her big sister, Nickole, and her parents, Ian and Nen, who are still trying to accept all of this. Thank you very much!<br /><img src="/images/legacy/3323.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /><br /><em>Nen, Dr. Sam, Pastor Ian with Baby Gabrielle</em></p>
