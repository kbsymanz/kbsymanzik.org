<p>Recently,  I sent the kids to school dressed as pirates!!<br />It was the school's carnival day.  This year's theme was "Pirates of the Philippines."  <br />The kids had a lot of fun playing the various games the different grades had set up....sword fighting, sunken treasure, sink the boat, etc.,<br />All proceeds will be going to a local orphanage.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/442.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/441.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/452.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p><p><img src="/images/legacy/439.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></p>
