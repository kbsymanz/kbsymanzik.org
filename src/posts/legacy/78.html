<p>We recently went to Nasuli, about a 4 hour trip from here.  On this trip we had the opportunity to go to a village.  We visited with a wonderful lady named BeBe who has worked with <span class="caps">SIL</span> since she was 17.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/198.jpg" title=""Bebe"" alt=""Bebe"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Bebe</em></p><p>She gave us our first taste of durian.  None of us were too impressed with it.  It tastes like a mix of rotting onion and fresh garlic.  Some people absolutely love it.  We've been told it takes several times of trying it to acquire a taste for it.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/199.jpg" title=""Durian in a bowl"" alt=""Durian in a bowl"" width="300" height="225" /><br /><em>Durian in a bowl</em></p><p>She walked us around her village.
