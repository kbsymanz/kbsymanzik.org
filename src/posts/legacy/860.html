<p>Giving thanks for <span class="caps">ALL</span> things.........<br />Learning to focus on the small graces of each day.....<br />A friend back in the states calls this looking for the God moments....<br />They are all around us.....</p><p>how easy, when wearied by the battle, to lose focus of God's mercy and grace....<br />the learning to give thanks in all things in a learned habit....</p><p>JR Miller states:    "Christian thanksgiving is the life of Christ in the heart --  transforming the disposition and the whole character.</p>    Thanksgiving must be wrought into the life as a habit--before it can become a fixed and permanent quality.    An occasional burst of praise, in the midst of years of complaining, is not what is required. Songs on rare, sunshiny days; and no songs when skies are cloudy--will not make a life of gratitude. The heart must learn to sing always.    This lesson is learned only when it becomes a habit which nothing can weaken. We must persist in being thankful.    When we can see no reason for praise--we must believe in the divine love and goodness, and sing in the darkness.    Thanksgiving has attained its rightful place in us, only when it is part of all our days and dominates all our experiences."    J. R. Miller, 1912<p>Are you, like Paul, learning to be content whatever the circumstances? Philippians 4:11</p><p>I know I am learning....<br />There is joy in the journey.........</p><p>and the deliberate giving of thanks in all things is an on-going learned habit..............</p>
