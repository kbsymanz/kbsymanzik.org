<p>13 years ago today my Dad died of a sudden heart attack.</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/1732.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="455" /></p><p>Below are the lyrics to a song I had written for my Dad the Father's Day prior to his death.  I'm thankful I was able to share this song with him before he died.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />My Father used to sing to me "The Old Rugged Cross"<br />Tucked me in and rubbed my back and said "good night my child."<br />His tenor voice would fill the room with sweet refrains of hymns<br />And in my tender childhood days I knew I'd trust in Him </p><p>Images of Jesus' death emblazened in my mind<br />"Wondrous'ly attracting me to the Dear Lamb of God"*<br />"Amazing Grace" has saved my soul and "It Is Well"<br />"I Love To Tell The Story" that "Jesus Paid It All." </p><p>       As Father and Daughter we've travled rough roads<br />       And I never thanked my father for singing me those hymns</p><p>I pray that in his twilight years he knows I've forgiven him<br />Memories of good times shared far outweigh the bad <br />All things work together for good to those who love God<br />I pray his soul has answered Him and His glory forever he'll share.</p><p>So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, where my trophies at last I'll lay down <br />I will cling to the old rugged cross, and exchange it someday for a crown.</p><p>I'm passing on the good things to children of my own<br />Singing them the hymns I heard and grew to love so<br />"Blest Be The Ties" and "God Be With You", "I'm Going Home" <br />Songs rich in truth passed lovingly from him to me to them.</p><p>/To the old rugged cross I will ever be true, it's shame and reproach gladly bear/<br />/Then He'll call me someday to my home far away where His glory forever / <br />/I'll share /<br />/So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, where my trophies at last I'll lay down/<br />/I will cling to the old rugged cross, and exchange it someday for a crown./<br />--------------------------------- <br />Copyright 1996 - All Rights Reserved :  * Line excerpted from "The Old Rugged Cross"<br />"The Old Rugged Cross" copyright 1913 by George Bernard.
