Proud of you, Ben!</em></p><p><em>1 Corinthians 9:25-27</em><br /><em>Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it</em><br /><em>to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.</em><br /><em>So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air.</em><br /><em>But I discipline my body and keep it under control...</em></p>
