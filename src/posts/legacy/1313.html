<p>I awoke this morning from a dream in which I was sharing with one of my sisters who'd been telling me that she didn't feel good enough to be accepted by Christ.  I shared with her what God had told me:</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3713.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><br />"Just as you love Jerard just as he is, so I love you just as you are.  Just be."</p><p><img src="/images/legacy/3654.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><br />"Just as Jerard melts into you when you hold him I want you to melt in to Me.  Rest in Me.  Just Rest."</p><p>There is no "good enough" to earn God's love - we just receive it as a wonderful gift, unmerited, from our gracious Abba Father.</p>
