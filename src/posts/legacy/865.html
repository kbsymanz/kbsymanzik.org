<p>Perhaps you have heard Mindanao was hit by a tropical storm.<br />While we here in Davao faired well, in other parts of Mindanao devastation has reigned....over 400 are dead....villages swept away in flash flooding....pray for those affected by this storm....<br /><img src="/images/legacy/2799.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="230" /><br /><em>just one of many, many images of devastation</em></p>
