<p>The surgery is scheduled for 1 PM on Thursday (tomorrow).  We are still waiting whether the doctor will order blood to be on hand.  If/when the order comes, I need to go to the Red Cross tonight and try to obtain the blood.  If things go well, I will walk out the door with blood in a bag on ice which I will then take to the hospital.  If they do not have it, we will need to try to find a AB+ donor, which is relatively rare here in the Philippines, and then I will walk out the door with the blood.</p><p>This is something that I still have trouble getting used to as compared to the US -- driving around the city in a taxi transporting blood to the hospital for an operation.</p>
