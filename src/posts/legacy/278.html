<p>James and Jerard will be 10 months old tomorrow!<br />It has been amazing to see how they have changed in the 8 months we have had them.<br />We thank God that they are both healthy and doing well!</p><p>James is very mobile and we are having some baby gates made to help 'baby proof' the house.</p><p>Jerard is starting to roll over on his own....3 times in the past 4 days or so!  It's good to see him showing more interest in his world, vocalizing more, staying awake more!!!!</p>
