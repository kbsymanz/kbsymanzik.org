<p>We had a court hearing today for James' adoption.  Basically the paperwork submitted was authenticated and approved today.  We have another hearing September 24th to hopefully finalize the adoption.</p><p>Why God has us on what seems to be the long road or slow track for this adoption process we do not know but we do know this....</p><p>The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup;  He holds our lot.  The lines have fallen for us in pleasant places; we have a beautiful inheritance.  We will bless the Lord who gives us counsel; in the night also His heart instructs us.  We have set the Lord always before us and we will not be shaken.  He is at our right hand.  Our hearts are glad in His leading and our whole being rejoices.  In Him we dwell secure.   (based on Psalm 16)</p><p>And like Fanny Crosby so beautifully penned.....<br /><em>All the way my Savior leads me,</em><br /><em>What have I to ask beside?</em><br /><em>Can I doubt His tender mercy,</em><br /><em>Who through life has been my Guide?</em><br /><em>Heav'nly peace, divinest comfort,</em><br /><em>Here by faith in Him to dwell!</em><br /><em>For I know, whate'er befall me,</em><br /><em>Jesus doeth all things well;</em><br /><em>For I know, whate'er befall me,</em><br /><em>Jesus doeth all things well.</em></p><p>We are disappointed the adoption was not completed today but we trust Him and His soveriegn guidance.  Pray with us for the adoption to be completed His way and for His glory.  Thanks.</p>
