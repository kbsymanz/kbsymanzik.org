The other day we found a baby Kingfisher bird in our laundry area.  Since it is a walled in area we can only guess that the bird dropped in from a nearby nest on a ledge.

Kurt picked the bird up and released it to the empty lot/swamp next to our home. The bird took off running, seemingly enjoying it's freedom after being in a cement, walled area overnight!
