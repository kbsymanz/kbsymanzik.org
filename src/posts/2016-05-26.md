Kirsten graduated from high school May 26, 2016.  We are so proud of her.  She is taking a gap year.  She and I will come to the USA in August.

The main speaker encouraged the graduates to find a place (community) to worship with, pray, make wise choices, and put God first in all they do.  It was a great message.

One of their teachers gave them a blessing from Romans 15:13 - May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.
