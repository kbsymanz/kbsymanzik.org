*"'For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the LORD, 
'... plans to give you hope and a future.'" Jeremiah 29:11*

Kirsten will be taking a gap year to research career options and colleges, learn to drive, visit relatives and adjust to life in the USA.  She and I (Beth) will be coming to the USA in August.
