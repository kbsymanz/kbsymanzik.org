Kurt and I just returned from a five day trip to the Manila and northern Luzon areas to visit some maternity clinics and share about the software Kurt has been writing for maternity centers to use - EMR (electronic medical records) specifically for lay-in clinics in third world countries.

We saw amazing beauty, met many wonderful people.  I'm thankful we had this opportunity.
I'll let Kurt share more from his end.  But I wanted to share a few photos of our trip.

The trip was enriching and refreshing.  Sometimes, when working on a project, it's good to get a renewed sense of purpose.  All three clinics want the software.  Kurt may be making a trip back to help install needed hardware in at least one of the clinics as well as train them in using the software.  There are plans to share with other clinics being made as well.
