Wayside Inn....The October 1862 visit to the old Howe Tavern by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his publisher, James Fields, would have a far reaching impact on the literary and artistic significance of America's oldest hostelry. Longfellow made the defunct Sudbury tavern the gathering place for the characters in his 1863 book *Tales of a Wayside Inn*, and because of the poet's immense popularity, generations of readers, poets, and artists would seek out the colonial landmark for decades to come.  It's fun to go in and see the rooms as they used to be, to eat in the restaurant and visit the museum.  You can feel the history.

Longfellow's Wayside Inn is proud to be the oldest operating Inn in the country, offering comfort and hospitality to travelers along the Boston Post Road since 1716.
