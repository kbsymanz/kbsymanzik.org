There has been much road work going on around our home and neighborhood
lately.  It always amazes me to see the workers in flip-flops working around
heavy equipment, cement pipes, pouring cement, etc.  So, here are scenes from
our neighborhood this week.

This is the pot they were using to warm the tar for filling in road cracks.

And, in the empty lot next door, there are cows grazing.  They are fun to
watch.  One of them has a calf.
