On any given day, according to http://earthquaketrack.com/, there are over 100 earthquakes registering 1.5 or greater on the Richter scale.
As I type this, the current stats are as follows:
	100 earthquakes in the past 24 hours
	636 earthquakes in the past 7 days
	3,332 earthquakes in the past 30 days
	38,969 earthquakes in the past 365 days  (http://earthquaketrack.com/)

It truly is amazing to dwell on the fact the earth crust is not this solid, steady, never-moving piece of rock that most of us believe it is.

Which makes me ponder even deeper on my loving Abba's Words - 
Psalm 60:2 states, "You have made the land to quake; you have torn it open;"

Psalm 99: 1-3 states, "The Lord reigns; let the peoples tremble!
    He sits enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake!
The Lord is great in Zion;
    he is exalted over all the peoples. Let them praise your great and awesome name!
    Holy is he!"

There are at least 17 references in the Bible to the mountains and earth quaking in the presence of God.

Do we?  Do we stand in awe of Him and His greatness?

Hebrews 12 encourages us in this.  The chapter is titled "The Kingdom That Cannot Be Shaken".  We are to be grateful for receiving His salvation, His Kingdom.  We ought not to refuse Him and His leading.

"28 Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, 29 for our God is a consuming fire.Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe,"
