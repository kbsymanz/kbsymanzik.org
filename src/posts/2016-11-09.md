Kirsten accomplished another adult first today - she voted.

(don't worry - we didn't take any selfies at the voting place; I nabbed this photo off a news website here in Michigan)

So now, Kirsten has her driver's license, has voted for the first time, recently filled out a job application for the first time.  Lots of firsts for her!

We've also both been enjoying the beauty of fall - a season that is non-existent in tropical Philippines.

We were recently blessed with a greatly discounted beauty-salon visit. Kirsten now sprouts new color in her hair, and I had highlights added to my hair.
