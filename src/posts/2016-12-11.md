I write.  I find writing enjoyable, therapeutic.
I've been organizing some of my writings into a compendium.  I came across this one I wrote when we were in the process of selling items to move overseas.  Hope you enjoy it.

## MOVING SALE DAY

```verse
Moving sale day.
Items once treasured now marked for sale at less than emotional value.
How can you put a price on attachment?  It is a grief a heart bears in itself.
Little griefs mark our lives.
Selling a blanket used for years, selling dishes many happy meals were shared on, selling towels used for 
drying and cleaning. Selling appliances, furniture, carpets, clothing.  All aspects of daily life marked 
with magic marker price tags of masking tape and low money amounts.
Needing to get rid of these daily life items to move on to another location, another continent, another 
assignment.
Life is letting go and accumulating and letting go, endless cycle.
Like Ecclesiastes talks about - a time to live, a time to die, a time to cry, a time to keep from crying, 
a time to be born, and a time to die;
a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;
a time to kill, and a time to heal;  a time to break down,
and a time to build up; a time to weep, and a time to laugh;
a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; a time to seek,
and a time to lose;  time to keep, and a time to cast away; a time to tear,
and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; a time to love,
and a time to hate;
a time for war, and a time for peace.

Cycles, ebb and flow, waves on sand, beach ever changing shape;
sand dunes remade in every blowing wind,
baby growing and changing from helpless infant to adult to old person to death to eternal life.
Nothing stays the same.  Change is constant.

The chatter of yard sale customers brings me back from reverie.
How much for this?  Can I get this and this for this amount?  Bargaining.
Customers happily carrying wares home, thankful for good finds;
sellers left relieved to have stuff gone but saddened at its disappearal.

Grief is constant.  Not only death of loved ones, but death of life lived in certain area, loss of 
contact with friends when they or you move away, sadness at broken bowl or lost ring that represents 
so much more than words can say.

A time to mourn.  A time to embrace change.  A time to grow.  A time to let go.
