We received a Christmas card today from some dear friends in the Chicago area.
They had mailed it out December 14, 2015.

There is a faint Mexico postal stamp on the back of the envelope.

And it arrived in Davao on July 8, 2016.

Mail here can be unpredictable and I think this letter was on quite a journey before it arrived here!
