## Transition, TCKs, OFWs


Kirsten and I leave the Philippines soon to journey to the USA. I can't say we
are moving "home" because "home" isn't one place for us any more. Kirsten will
settle into the USA, I'll be flying between "homes" for a while.

Part of the truth of third-culture-kids (TCKs) is that their heart home is
most likely not their passport country, and family can be spread over
continents. The Internet, Skype, and international cell phones makes
conversation and staying in touch a bit easier but also can pull at
heart-strings, making conversations bittersweet.

Kirsten is taking a 'gap-year-in-reverse' as she and I are calling it. Most
students take a gap year to live abroad, help in missions, explore career
opportunities; Kirsten's gap year will consist of learning her passport
country culture and ways, exploring colleges and career options, learning to
drive, visiting relatives and friends, working part time, etc.

It's all a bit weird, this season of our lives.

It feels a bit like a wilderness to me.

Words fail to describe the "halo-halo" (mix-mix) of emotion and pulling family needs.

We are a bit like the many overseas foreign workers (OFWs) that leave the
Philippines to work elsewhere. Part of the family stays in the Philippines
while a member or two travel abroad to work.

No matter where any of us are, though, there is a calm in my heart that my
Abba ordains my ways and the ways of each of us in this family (Psalm 16:11).
He is caring and guiding and leading. As Jeremiah says in chapter 31, we find
grace in the wilderness (v. 2), and we rest in His love and faithfulness (v.
3).

Part of that grace is exemplified in the niches God provides each of us:
Mikayla is teaching English part-time at Faith International. She is gaining
practical skills to accompany her dual-degree in upper education (middle
school - high school) and English. Ben is in high school and on sports teams.
He excels in the sciences, maths, and athletics. James is schooling at home
under Mikayla's tutelage as well as taking specials at FIA in art, music, and
PE. He will also soon start flute lessons, an instrument he's been wanting to
play for several years now.  Kurt is providing much-needed software to
maternity clinics that serve the poor.  His work is fulfilling to him and to
those served. All graces from our loving Abba.

Soon, Kirsten and I will board a plane to the USA. Kirsten has no plans to
return to the Philippines as she transitions forward to college and life in
her passport country.  I'll be returning to the Philippines in about 5 months
and then return to the USA late April 2017 to finish my masters degree "if the
Lord wills"....(James 4:13-15)

All is well to rest in His grace that He provides. He tenderly exudes His
everlasting love in the variety of ways He leads, in the seasons He leads each
of us through.  It truly is grace. And as His child, I give Him thanks in all
things (1 Thess. 5:18).


```verse
Lead on, O King eternal;
we follow, not with fears,
for gladness breaks like morning
where'er your face appears.
Your cross is lifted o'er us,
we journey in its light;
the crown awaits the conquest;
lead on, O God of might.
```
