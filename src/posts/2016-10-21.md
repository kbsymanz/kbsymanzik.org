My daughter and I went to the Secretary of State today for her driver's
license. We were talking as we drove to the office that we both felt like this
would be an all-afternoon affair like dealing with government offices can be
in the Philippines. We knew it probably wouldn't be but after ten years in the
Philippines it's hard to break those thought processes.

Her appointment was at 1:30 pm. We were back in the car by 1:45 pm.

"Did I really just get my license that quickly?" she asked me, incredulously.

"Yes. I feel like I need to pinch myself and ask 'is this real'?" I replied.

We laughed, thoroughly enjoying the efficiency, the ease, the fastness of the
whole process.  We really like the friendliness and helpfulness of the clerks.
Our clerk was probably wondering what was wrong with us when, after he said
"you're all done and your card will come within 30 days", we replied, "we are
all done?!?!"  "All done," he stated.

Wow!! Amazing efficiency!
