In April, the high school vocal music class presented a concert.  The last song they sang that evening was called *The Blessing* - the lyrics taken from an Irish Blessing  - -

> *May the road rise up to meet you.
> May the wind always be at your back.
> May the sun shine warm upon your face,
> and rains fall soft upon your fields.
> And until we meet again,
> May God hold you in the palm of His hand.*

This is an appropriate blessing for anyone.  As I listened to the class sing it I felt it was an especially appropriate blessing for the seniors singing in that group - Kirsten, Joy, Soy, Janey, John.

Enjoy listening!
