Today we celebrate Kirsten's 18th birthday.  We took her to her favourite restaurant for lunch.  I pray that God, our Father of peace Himself, will continue to sanctify her completely, and that her whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  He who calls her and each of us if faithful.  He will surely do it. (based on 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24).

Father's day falls on Kirsten's birthday this year.  We enjoyed lunch at a favourite restaurant and giving gifts to both Kirsten and to Kurt.  He is a great dad to his kids and I'm thankful for him as my husband.

I pray and commend each member of my family to my Abba, God, and to the word of His grace, which is able to build each of us up and to give each of us the inheritance among all those who are sanctified (based on Acts 20:32).
