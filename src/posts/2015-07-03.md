Our new rental has a Star Fruit tree in the front yard. The fruit tastes a bit
like a mix of crisp apple and sweet grapes. It's good!

It is a native of the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Bangladesh and
Sri Lanka.

Another fruit we recently picked up at the market for the first time is called
spondias - also known as the Spanish plum. It's a bit like eating an apple in
texture and taste. Lamay kaayo! ("very good!")
