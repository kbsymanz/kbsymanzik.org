I received a letter the other day informing me my name has been written in a
book for who's who among students in American Universities and colleges.

One of the sentences in the letter states, "It is my great pleasure to
officially announce that you are a part of this elite group..."

*Luke 10:20 "...but **rejoice that your names are written in heaven."***

While happy to receive the recognition (and a chance for a scholarship), it
got me thinking that more than anything, the only "elite group" I really
desire to be a part of is the Kingdom of my Heavenly Daddy.  May I always
strive to live according to His ways as outlined in His Holy Word.  I am
thankful He has engraved me on His hand, loves me just as I am, and will
welcome me into His eternal Kingdom when that day comes!

*Isaiah 49:16  (God speaking) "...**Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of
my hands"***

"Jesus loves me, this I know".....

and to me, that is the highest honor.

*Isaiah 43: 1-4  "Fear not, for I have redeemed you"*

**I have called you by name, you are mine.**

"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by
my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world.'"
