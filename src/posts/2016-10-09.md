Kirsten and I have been in the USA almost 2 months now.  We've had many travels and visited many people.

We started in Houston, Texas visiting my sister.  Houston is as hot if not hotter than Davao some days - at least while we were there.

Kirsten's classmate, Joy, came to Michigan and we picked her up from the airport.  They have been friends since third grade.
