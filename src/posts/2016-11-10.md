This morning, as the sun rises, I am grateful for the reminder that there is light in the world and that the True Light rules over all the affairs of us earthly beings created in His image (1 Kings 12:15, Genesis 1:26).

I miss the 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of dark that is so consistent in Davao. I miss being with my whole family.  I am grateful to be with my daughter as she transitions. I am grateful for Skype and the ability to see and talk with family half a world a way even if it leaves me melancholy afterwards.

I'm not able to feel settled in here with the majority of my family in the Philippines.  I'm in a state of "between" - and this unsettledness reminds me to settle restfully in my Father's love, watch care, and guidance - to practice center-point living.  That's my name for it.  Jesus tells me, tells all of us, in Matthew 6:33 to seek Him first.  Every moment of every day, seek Him.

Colossians 3, one of my favourite chapters in the Bible, reminds me to set my mind on things above - on His way. My Abba reminds me, in all my ways, to listen well, love well, be thankful, do everything - word or deed, in His name - Center-point living.

And in the moments when my momma heart bleeds profuse missing my family half way around the world, I cast my cares on Him and seek Him first.

And in the moments when depression blankets loved ones so profoundly they lose hope of another day, I seek Him first.

Those moments I dread the upcoming holidays because our family is not together, I seek Him first.

I hear the question play through my mind, "What do I understand by the providence of God?"  I know that He is almighty and ever present and that nothing comes to us by chance but by His loving Fatherly hand (Heidelberg Q. A. 27) (Jer 23:23, 24; Acts 17:24-28.  Heb 1:3.  Jer 5:24; Acts 14:15-17; Jn 9:3; Prov 22:2.  Prov 16:33.  Mt 10:29.)

The benefit/peace of this center-point knowing that God creates and ordains all is that I can be patient in adversity, thankful in prosperity, and hopeful for the future.  Nothing can separate me from His love.  All things, all people, all affairs of state, government, world are so completely in His hand that without His will they cannot so much as move (Heidelberg Q.A. 28) (Job 1:21, 22; Ps 39:10; Jas 1:3.  Deut 8:10; 1 Thess 5:18.  Ps 55:22; Rom 5:3-5; 8:38, 39.  Job 1:12; 2:6; Prov 21:1; Acts 17:24-28.).

He is our great High priest.  He understands moods and hopes and despair and desire - "...we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4: 15-16).

So remain confident, draw near to His throne of grace, receive His mercy and grace, know that He is sovereign over all and rest - "Rest, the Lord is near; Refuse to fear, enjoy His love" (Steve Green).
